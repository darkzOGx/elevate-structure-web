Commercial tenant improvement (TI) projects in Pasadena range from simple office reconfigurations to complete restaurant build-outs requiring extensive structural modifications. Whether you're a tenant preparing a new space, a landlord accommodating a tenant's needs, or a contractor bidding on TI work, understanding when and why structural engineering is required helps ensure smooth permitting and construction.

This comprehensive guide is part of our [Commercial & Industrial Structural Engineering Guide](/blog/commercial-industrial-structural-engineering-guide) and covers everything you need to know about tenant improvement structural engineering in Pasadena.

## What Is Commercial Tenant Improvement Engineering?

Commercial tenant improvement structural engineering evaluates and designs structural modifications required when adapting an existing commercial space for a new use. TI structural engineers address:

- **Load-bearing wall modifications** including removals and new openings
- **New equipment loads** including HVAC, kitchen equipment, and special uses
- **Mezzanine and platform structures** for additional floor area
- **Storefront modifications** including new doors and windows
- **Roof penetrations** for exhaust fans and mechanical equipment
- **Floor reinforcement** for heavy storage or equipment

In Pasadena, tenant improvement projects must comply with:

1. **California Building Code (CBC) 2025** - Structural requirements
2. **Pasadena Municipal Code** - Local amendments
3. **Historic preservation requirements** - For buildings in historic districts
4. **Original building structural system** - Capacity limitations

**Pasadena Building Department Contact:**
- Phone: (626) 744-4200
- Address: 175 North Garfield Avenue, Pasadena, CA 91101
- Plan Check Turnaround: 3-4 weeks for TI projects

## When Does a Tenant Improvement Require Structural Engineering?

### Always Requires a Structural Engineer

## What Is the TI Structural Engineering Process?

### Step 1: Scope Assessment (1-2 Days)
Initial project review:

1. **Review architectural TI plans** - Understanding proposed changes
2. **Review existing building documents** - Original structural drawings
3. **Site visit** (if needed) - Existing conditions verification
4. **Scope determination** - What structural work is required
5. **Fee proposal** - Fixed-fee quote

### Step 2: Structural Analysis (3-5 Days)
Engineering evaluation:

- **Existing capacity analysis** - What can the building support?
- **Load calculations** - New equipment and occupancy loads
- **Modification design** - Headers, beams, reinforcement
- **Connection design** - To existing structure

### Step 3: Construction Documents (5-7 Days)
PE-stamped drawings:

- **Structural plans** - Showing modifications
- **Details** - Connection and reinforcement details
- **Calculations** - Supporting engineering backup
- **Coordination notes** - For other trades

### Step 4: Permitting Support (2-4 Weeks)
Pasadena permit assistance:

- Plan check submittal (coordinated with architect)
- Response to plan checker comments
- Phone consultations with plan check staff

### Standard Project Timeline
**Total time from contract to permit: 3-5 weeks**
- Engineering: 2 weeks
- Plan check: 2-3 weeks (can be concurrent with other disciplines)

## How Much Does TI Structural Engineering Cost in Pasadena?

### Fee Ranges by Project Type

| TI Type | Typical Scope | Engineering Fee | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Office Renovation | 1-2 wall modifications | $3,000-$5,000 | 2 weeks |
| Retail Build-Out | Storefront + walls | $5,000-$8,000 | 2-3 weeks |
| Restaurant | Full kitchen, hood, cooler | $8,000-$15,000 | 3-4 weeks |
| Medical Office | Equipment + modifications | $6,000-$12,000 | 3 weeks |
| Gym/Fitness | Heavy loads + equipment | $8,000-$15,000 | 3-4 weeks |
| Mezzanine | New structure | $12,000-$25,000 | 4-6 weeks |

### Cost Factors
TI engineering fees vary based on:

1. **Number of structural modifications** - More changes = higher fee
2. **Existing building documentation** - Missing drawings increase effort
3. **Historic building status** - Additional requirements
4. **Equipment complexity** - Heavy or unusual loads
5. **Timeline requirements** - Rush fees for expedited service

### Value of Professional Engineering

**Cost of NOT hiring an engineer:**
- Permit rejection and redesign: 4-8 weeks delay
- Change orders during construction: 10-20% cost increase
- Failed inspections: Project delays
- Potential unsafe conditions: Liability exposure

## What Are Common TI Structural Challenges in Pasadena?

### Historic Buildings
Pasadena has many historic commercial buildings:

- **Unreinforced masonry** - Limited modification options
- **Ornate facades** - Preservation requirements
- **Original documentation** - Often unavailable
- **Historic district review** - Additional approval required

### Older Construction
Pre-1970s buildings often have:

- **Inadequate lateral systems** - Triggering upgrades
- **Unknown conditions** - Requiring investigation
- **Non-standard framing** - Custom solutions needed
- **Lead and asbestos** - Coordination with abatement

### Mixed-Use Buildings
Buildings with residential above:

- **Noise and vibration** - Restaurant/gym restrictions
- **Fire separation** - Maintaining rated assemblies
- **Structural capacity** - May be limited
- **Construction hours** - Tenant coordination

### Landlord Constraints
Building owner requirements:

- **Pre-approved modifications** - Limited scope
- **Insurance requirements** - Engineering documentation
- **Restoration obligations** - End of lease considerations
- **Building systems** - HVAC, electrical capacity

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can you complete TI structural engineering in Pasadena?
Standard TI structural engineering takes 2 weeks for typical projects. Rush service is available for 1-week turnaround at premium rates. Add 2-3 weeks for Pasadena Building Department plan check.

### Do I need a structural engineer for a simple office renovation?
If your renovation involves load-bearing wall modifications, new openings, or adding significant equipment loads, yes. If it's purely cosmetic with non-load-bearing partitions, probably not. We can advise with a quick review of your plans.

### How do I know if a wall is load-bearing?
Load-bearing walls typically run perpendicular to floor joists and align with walls or supports below. However, only a structural engineer can make the definitive determination by reviewing existing drawings or conducting a site investigation.

### What information do you need to quote a TI project?
At minimum, we need the architectural TI plans and building address. Helpful additional information includes existing building drawings, proposed use, equipment specifications, and target permit date.

### Can you help expedite Pasadena plan check?
While we cannot guarantee expedited city review, our thorough plans typically pass with minimal comments, avoiding delays from corrections. We also respond promptly to any plan check comments to keep the process moving.

### Do you provide construction phase support for TI projects?
Yes, we're available to answer contractor questions, review shop drawings, and address RFIs during construction. We can also provide site observation if required by the building department.

### What happens if the existing building drawings aren't available?
We can work with limited information but may need a site visit to verify existing conditions. In some cases, selective demolition may be required to confirm existing framing before finalizing design.

### How do historic building requirements affect TI engineering?
Pasadena's historic districts may limit visible modifications and require additional review. Structural solutions must respect historic fabric while meeting current code. We have experience navigating these requirements.
