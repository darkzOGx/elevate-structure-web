## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there really an engineer available at 3 AM?
Yes. We maintain on-call coverage 24/7/365. An actual California-licensed PE is available to respond to calls at any hour. Response times for callbacks are typically 15-30 minutes, with site visits within 2-4 hours if needed.

### How much more does after-hours service cost?
After-hours service typically includes a 25-75% premium over standard rates depending on the time and day. Emergency situations during overnight hours or holidays may include higher premiums. We always discuss costs before dispatch.

### Can issues wait until business hours?
Many situations can wait, and we'll tell you honestly if that's the case. We help you evaluate urgency during the initial phone consultation. If waiting creates risk of additional damage or safety concerns, we recommend immediate response.

### Do you serve Bel Air directly or is travel time included?
We serve Bel Air directly with response times of 2-4 hours for after-hours emergencies. Our service area includes all of the Westside and greater Los Angeles. Travel time to Bel Air is factored into our response capabilities.

### What if I just have a quick question after hours?
Phone consultations are available after hours at reduced rates compared to site visits. Many concerns can be addressed with a 15-30 minute phone call to evaluate the situation and determine next steps.

### How do international clients typically use 24-hour service?
International buyers often need assessments scheduled around their time zones. We accommodate early morning or late evening inspections, provide real-time communication during their business hours, and deliver reports to meet their decision timelines.

### Are weekend inspections available for non-emergencies?
Yes, we offer weekend scheduling for urgent but non-emergency situations like transaction deadlines or construction discoveries. Weekend appointments include a premium but provide flexibility when weekday scheduling doesn't work.

### What documentation do you provide for after-hours assessments?
After-hours assessments receive the same professional documentation as standard service: PE-stamped reports, photographs, findings, and recommendations. Reports are typically delivered within 24-48 hours of the assessment.
