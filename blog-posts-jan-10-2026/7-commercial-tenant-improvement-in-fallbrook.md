## What Should Landlords and Tenants Know About Structural TI Work?

**Direct Answer:** Landlords and tenants should understand that structural modifications require engineering, permits, and inspections; costs and responsibilities should be clearly allocated in lease agreements; work affects building value and future tenant flexibility; and proper documentation protects both parties.

### Landlord Considerations

**Building Protection:**

- Original construction must support modifications
- Future flexibility may be impacted

**Documentation:**
- As-built drawings after modifications
- Engineering reports for records
- Permit cards and inspection records

**Liability:**
- Work must meet current codes
- Insurance implications
- Building official relationships

### Tenant Considerations

**Cost Planning:**
- Engineering fees in addition to construction
- Permit fees and timeline
- Potential inspection delays

**Lease Negotiations:**
- Who pays for structural engineering?
- Landlord approval processes
- Restoration requirements at lease end

**Timeline Reality:**
- Engineering: 2-4 weeks
- Permitting: 3-6 weeks
- Construction: Varies by scope

### Lease Agreement Provisions

Effective leases address:

- **Modification Approval:** Process for landlord approval of structural changes
- **Engineering Responsibility:** Who commissions and pays for engineering
- **Permit Compliance:** Requirements for proper permits
- **Restoration:** Whether modifications remain or must be removed at lease end

## Frequently Asked Questions About Tenant Improvement Engineering in Fallbrook

### Do I need an engineer for every tenant improvement in Fallbrook?

**Answer:** Not every tenant improvement requires structural engineering. Cosmetic modifications like painting, flooring, non-structural partition walls, and electrical/plumbing within existing walls typically don't need structural engineering. However, any modification to structural walls, addition of mezzanines, installation of heavy equipment, or creation of openings in existing walls requires engineering. When in doubt, consult with the San Diego County Building Division.

### How long does tenant improvement engineering take?

**Answer:** Tenant improvement structural engineering typically requires 1-3 weeks depending on complexity. Simple wall openings with available building plans may take a week. Complex mezzanine designs or renovations with limited existing documentation may take 3 weeks or more. Provide existing building plans if available to accelerate the process.

### Can I start construction before engineering is complete?

**Answer:** Non-structural work can proceed while structural engineering is completed, but structural modifications must wait for PE-stamped plans and building permits. Plan your construction sequence carefully—often non-structural work (demolition, utility rough-in) can proceed while awaiting structural permits. Coordinate with your contractor and building department.

### Who is responsible for tenant improvement engineering costs?

**Answer:** Responsibility for engineering costs depends on lease terms. Some landlords provide engineering as part of tenant allowances. Others require tenants to commission and pay for all engineering. Build-to-suit arrangements may include engineering in base building costs. Review your lease carefully and negotiate engineering responsibilities before signing.

### What if the existing building can't support my modifications?

**Answer:** When existing structures can't support proposed modifications, options include strengthening the existing structure, modifying the design to reduce demands, relocating heavy elements to stronger areas, or reconsidering the space for the intended use. Our engineers evaluate existing capacity and recommend the most practical approach.

### Do I need the landlord's architect to do structural engineering?

**Answer:** Landlords may have preferred engineers or require approval of engineers selected by tenants. However, tenants are generally free to select their own PE-licensed structural engineers subject to landlord approval. Review lease requirements for any restrictions on consultant selection.
