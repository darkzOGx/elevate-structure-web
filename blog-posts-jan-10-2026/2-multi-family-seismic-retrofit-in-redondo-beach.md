**Updated: January 2026**

Multi-family seismic retrofit engineering in Redondo Beach addresses one of the most critical safety concerns facing apartment building owners and property managers throughout the South Bay region. Our PE-licensed structural engineers with over 20 years of experience provide comprehensive seismic retrofit design services for apartment buildings, condominiums, and multi-family structures in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Torrance, and surrounding coastal Los Angeles County communities.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake demonstrated the devastating vulnerability of soft-story buildings, causing billions in damage and multiple fatalities in apartment buildings with weak first floors. Since then, California has led nationwide efforts to retrofit these vulnerable structures, with mandatory programs in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and other jurisdictions. Redondo Beach property owners must understand their seismic retrofit obligations and the engineering solutions available to protect both tenants and property investments.

## What Is Multi-Family Seismic Retrofitting and Why Is It Required in Redondo Beach?

**Direct Answer:** Multi-family seismic retrofitting is the structural modification of apartment buildings and multi-unit residential structures to improve earthquake resistance, typically involving the addition of steel moment frames, plywood shear walls, or other lateral force-resisting elements to address weaknesses in buildings constructed before modern seismic codes.

In Redondo Beach, many apartment buildings constructed from the 1950s through the 1970s feature "soft-story" configurations—buildings with open ground floors for parking or commercial space that lack adequate lateral bracing. During earthquakes, these weak stories can collapse while upper floors remain relatively intact, a failure mode responsible for numerous deaths in past California earthquakes.

The California Building Code (CBC 2025) establishes requirements for existing building evaluation and retrofit, while individual jurisdictions adopt mandatory retrofit ordinances based on local building inventory and seismic risk. While Redondo Beach has not yet adopted a mandatory soft-story ordinance like neighboring Los Angeles, the city's seismic vulnerability makes proactive retrofitting essential for property protection and tenant safety.

Our [seismic retrofit engineering services](/services/seismic-retrofit) help Redondo Beach property owners evaluate their buildings' earthquake vulnerability and implement cost-effective strengthening solutions.

## What Types of Multi-Family Buildings Need Seismic Retrofitting in Redondo Beach?

**Direct Answer:** Multi-family buildings most likely to need seismic retrofitting in Redondo Beach include wood-frame apartment buildings with soft-story conditions (open ground floor parking), pre-1978 buildings constructed before modern seismic codes, buildings with cripple walls or inadequate foundation connections, and structures with heavy roofing materials that create excessive seismic mass.

### Soft-Story Buildings

Soft-story buildings represent the highest priority for seismic retrofitting. These structures typically feature:

- **Ground floor parking** with minimal structural walls
- **Tuck-under parking** where vehicles park beneath living units
- **Commercial ground floors** with large storefront openings
- **Open carports** with slender columns

The upper floors of these buildings have numerous partition walls that provide lateral resistance, while the ground floor has few or no such walls. During earthquake shaking, the ground floor absorbs disproportionate seismic forces and can collapse.

In Redondo Beach, soft-story buildings are common throughout the city, particularly in areas developed during the 1960s and 1970s apartment building boom. Properties along Artesia Boulevard, Aviation Boulevard, and the downtown Redondo Beach area often feature this vulnerable configuration.

### Pre-1978 Construction

Buildings constructed before 1978 generally predate significant seismic code improvements adopted following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. These older buildings often lack:

- Adequate foundation bolting
- Proper shear wall construction
- Sufficient hold-down connections
- Modern seismic detailing

### Cripple Wall Buildings

Older apartment buildings, particularly those converted from single-family homes, may feature cripple walls—short stud walls between the foundation and first floor. Without proper bracing, cripple walls can collapse during earthquakes, dropping the entire building several feet.

### Heavy Roof Buildings

Buildings with concrete tile, clay tile, or other heavy roofing materials experience greater seismic forces than lighter-roofed structures. When combined with other vulnerabilities, heavy roofs increase retrofit priority.

For a comprehensive evaluation of your Redondo Beach apartment building's seismic vulnerability, our engineers provide [structural assessments](/services/structural-assessment) identifying specific weaknesses and recommending appropriate retrofit measures.

## What Seismic Retrofit Methods Are Used for Redondo Beach Apartment Buildings?

**Direct Answer:** Common seismic retrofit methods for Redondo Beach multi-family buildings include steel moment frame installation, plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) shear wall addition, steel brace frames, foundation bolting and cripple wall bracing, and connection improvements throughout the structure.

### Steel Moment Frame Retrofit

Steel moment frames are the most common solution for soft-story apartment buildings with open ground floor parking. These rigid steel frames:

- **Maintain parking access** while providing lateral resistance
- **Resist both directions** of earthquake forces with minimal footprint
- **Transfer forces efficiently** from upper floors through the open story
- **Allow architectural flexibility** in garage layouts

A typical soft-story retrofit in Redondo Beach involves installing 2-6 steel moment frames in the ground floor, depending on building size and configuration. Frames connect to new or strengthened foundation elements and to the structure above.

**Cost considerations:** Steel moment frames typically cost $15,000-$40,000 per frame installed, making total retrofit costs for a typical apartment building $50,000-$200,000 or more depending on size and complexity.

### Plywood/OSB Shear Wall Retrofit

For buildings where moment frames are impractical or excessive, structural plywood or OSB shear walls provide lateral resistance at lower cost:

- **Most cost-effective solution** for many retrofit scenarios
- **Requires blocking openings** in some cases
- **Can be applied to existing walls** with limited disruption
- **Suitable for cripple wall and soft-story applications**

Shear wall retrofits work well when walls can be added without eliminating required parking spaces or significantly impacting building function.

### Steel Brace Frame Retrofit

Concentrically braced frames using steel tubes or angles offer another alternative:

- **Efficient force resistance** with minimal material
- **Can work in narrow spaces** between parking stalls
- **Less expensive than moment frames** in some applications
- **Visible industrial aesthetic** may be concern in some settings

### Foundation Improvements

Most seismic retrofits require foundation work to transfer forces from new lateral elements to the ground:

- **Foundation bolting:** Connecting the sill plate to the foundation
- **New concrete footings:** Supporting moment frame columns
- **Hold-down anchors:** Preventing overturning of shear walls
- **Continuous load paths:** Ensuring forces flow from roof to ground

### Connection Improvements

Beyond primary lateral elements, comprehensive seismic retrofits address connections throughout the structure:

- Roof-to-wall connections (hurricane ties)
- Floor-to-wall connections
- Shear wall hold-downs
- Collector elements at discontinuities

## How Much Does Multi-Family Seismic Retrofit Cost in Redondo Beach?

**Direct Answer:** Multi-family seismic retrofit costs in Redondo Beach typically range from $50,000-$200,000 for a typical soft-story apartment building, or approximately $10,000-$25,000 per unit, depending on building size, configuration, retrofit method, and existing structural conditions.

However, neighboring jurisdictions including Los Angeles have mandatory programs, and California continues to expand retrofit requirements. Proactive retrofitting provides safety benefits now and prepares for potential future requirements while avoiding deadline-driven contractor availability constraints.

### How do I know if my Redondo Beach apartment building needs seismic retrofit?

**Answer:** Signs indicating seismic retrofit need include ground floor parking or carports beneath living units (soft-story condition), building construction before 1978, visible diagonal cracks in stucco or masonry, signs of previous settlement or movement, and multiple stories of wood-frame construction. A professional seismic evaluation by a licensed structural engineer provides definitive assessment of retrofit need and priority.

### How long does seismic retrofit construction take for a typical apartment building?

**Answer:** Seismic retrofit construction for a typical Redondo Beach apartment building (8-16 units) generally requires 8-16 weeks, depending on retrofit complexity and phasing requirements. Larger buildings or those requiring extensive foundation work may take longer. Phased construction to maintain partial occupancy extends overall schedules but minimizes tenant displacement.

### Can tenants remain in the building during seismic retrofit?

**Answer:** Depending on the retrofit scope and building configuration, tenants may remain during some or all construction. Soft-story retrofits focused on the ground floor often allow upper-floor tenants to remain with minimal disruption. However, noise, dust, and temporary utility interruptions affect quality of life. Some retrofits require temporary tenant relocation for safety and construction efficiency. Your engineer and contractor can evaluate specific requirements for your building.

### Will seismic retrofit reduce my insurance premiums?

**Answer:** Some insurance carriers offer premium reductions for properly retrofitted buildings, though policies vary significantly. Contact your insurance provider about potential premium adjustments before beginning retrofit work. Documentation of completed retrofits, including engineering reports and building permit records, supports insurance discussions.

### How much does seismic retrofit cost per apartment unit?

**Answer:** Seismic retrofit costs for Redondo Beach apartment buildings typically range from $10,000-$25,000 per unit, with smaller buildings generally having higher per-unit costs due to fixed engineering and mobilization expenses. Actual costs depend on building size, configuration, retrofit method, and existing structural conditions. Our team provides preliminary estimates during initial consultations.

### Can I recover seismic retrofit costs through rent increases?

**Answer:** California rent control and tenant protection laws limit landlords' ability to recover capital improvement costs through rent increases. Rules vary by jurisdiction and existing lease terms. Some jurisdictions allow pass-through of a portion of seismic retrofit costs over time. Consult with a real estate attorney regarding cost recovery options for your specific situation.

### What financing options are available for seismic retrofits?

**Answer:** Seismic retrofit financing options include Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs that spread costs over 15-25 years through property tax assessments, conventional commercial loans, SBA 504 loans for eligible commercial properties, and refinancing that captures retrofit costs in new mortgage terms.
