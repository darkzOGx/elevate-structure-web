## Common Office Building Structural Challenges in San Bernardino

Office buildings in San Bernardino face several recurring structural challenges that require professional engineering solutions:

**Large Open Floor Plans**
Modern office design favors open floor plans with minimal columns. This requires longer structural spans, deeper beams or trusses, and careful deflection control. We design efficient long-span systems using steel joists, open-web joists, or post-tensioned concrete.

**Tenant Improvement Flexibility**
Office buildings must accommodate changing tenant needs. We design structural systems with adequate load capacity and clear spans to allow future modifications without costly structural upgrades.

**Rooftop HVAC and Solar**
Commercial buildings require substantial rooftop equipment loads. We design roof structures with adequate capacity for current and future equipment, properly distributed to avoid overloading individual members.

**Parking Structure Integration**
Many office buildings include integrated parking structures. These require careful coordination between parking levels (heavy vehicle loads) and office levels (standard occupancy loads), with proper transition zones and waterproofing between levels.

**Seismic Joint Requirements**
Larger office buildings may require seismic separation joints to divide the structure into smaller, more manageable sections. We design these joints to accommodate seismic movements while maintaining weatherproofing and architectural continuity.
