Commercial building seismic retrofit engineering addresses the critical need to upgrade older commercial structures for improved earthquake performance throughout Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena, and the Greater Los Angeles area. Our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with over 20 years of seismic retrofit experience deliver PE-stamped structural plans for soft-story retrofits, unreinforced masonry buildings, concrete tilt-up upgrades, and comprehensive seismic strengthening that meet California Building Code requirements and local jurisdiction mandates.

Glendale's diverse commercial building stock includes many structures built before modern seismic codes that require retrofitting to meet current safety standards. Our team understands the specific challenges of seismic retrofit in this Los Angeles County city, from navigating the City of Glendale's building department requirements to addressing the unique structural conditions found in the area's historic commercial buildings.

## What Is Commercial Building Seismic Retrofit in Glendale?

**Direct Answer:** Commercial building seismic retrofit involves strengthening existing structures to improve their earthquake resistance and bring them into compliance with current safety standards. In Glendale, this includes analyzing existing structural systems, designing reinforcement using steel moment frames, shear walls, or foundation upgrades, and producing PE-stamped construction documents accepted by the Glendale Building & Safety Division.

Commercial seismic retrofits address deficiencies in buildings constructed before modern seismic codes were adopted. California's seismic building code has evolved significantly since the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, and buildings from different eras present varying retrofit challenges. Our engineers assess each building's specific conditions and design cost-effective strengthening solutions.

For comprehensive information about commercial engineering services, see our [Commercial & Industrial Structural Engineering Guide](/blog/commercial-industrial-structural-engineering-guide).

## What Types of Commercial Seismic Retrofit Projects Do We Handle?

**Direct Answer:** We engineer all commercial seismic retrofit types including soft-story building retrofits, unreinforced masonry (URM) strengthening, concrete tilt-up wall anchor upgrades, steel building lateral system improvements, and comprehensive structural upgrades for high-value properties. Each project receives customized analysis and retrofit design addressing specific building deficiencies and owner objectives.

**Soft-Story Commercial Building Retrofit**
Soft-story buildings with weak ground floors due to large openings, parking, or open commercial spaces are particularly vulnerable to earthquake damage. Our engineers design steel moment frames, braced frames, or supplemental shear walls that strengthen ground floors while maintaining building functionality. Glendale commercial properties with soft-story conditions require careful retrofit design to preserve tenant operations.

**Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Building Retrofit**
Older brick and masonry commercial buildings common in Glendale's historic commercial areas require specialized retrofit approaches. Our engineers design steel bracing systems, supplemental shear walls, and wall-to-diaphragm connections that reduce URM building collapse risk while preserving architectural character where required.

**Concrete Tilt-Up Seismic Upgrades**
Pre-1994 concrete tilt-up buildings often lack adequate wall-to-roof connections and can experience catastrophic failure during earthquakes. Our engineers design connection upgrades, supplemental bracing, and foundation improvements that address these deficiencies per current California Building Code requirements.

**Voluntary Seismic Improvement Programs**
Beyond mandatory retrofit requirements, we assist commercial property owners pursuing voluntary seismic upgrades to reduce earthquake risk, lower insurance premiums, and enhance property value. Our engineers assess existing conditions and design retrofit solutions optimized for budget and building use.

## How Does the Commercial Seismic Retrofit Process Work in Glendale?

**Direct Answer:** The commercial seismic retrofit process typically takes 6-12 weeks from initial assessment to permit-ready documents, depending on building size and retrofit complexity. This includes structural evaluation, retrofit design development, construction document preparation, and PE stamping. Glendale Building & Safety plan check adds 3-6 weeks, with our engineers providing responsive correction support throughout.

- Foundation strengthening if required
- Construction sequencing for occupied buildings

**Phase 3: Construction Documents (Weeks 6-10)**

**PE-Stamped Plan Set Includes:**
- Existing and proposed structural plans
- Retrofit details and sections
- Connection details to existing elements
- Demolition and protection notes
- Special inspection requirements
- Construction sequence recommendations

**Phase 4: Permit and Construction Support (Weeks 10+)**

- Glendale Building & Safety plan check support
- Plan check correction response
- Pre-construction meetings with contractor
- Construction observation services available
- Special inspection coordination

## How Much Does Commercial Seismic Retrofit Cost in Glendale?

**Direct Answer (2026 Pricing):** Commercial seismic retrofit engineering in Glendale typically costs $15,000-$75,000 for structural engineering services, varying by building size, construction type, and retrofit complexity. Soft-story retrofits for multi-tenant commercial buildings average $25,000-$45,000 for engineering, while comprehensive URM retrofits may exceed $75,000 for complex projects.

## What Are the Seismic Retrofit Requirements in Glendale?

**Direct Answer:** Glendale follows Los Angeles County mandatory retrofit ordinances for soft-story buildings and unreinforced masonry structures. Commercial property owners may receive retrofit orders requiring compliance within specified timeframes. Additionally, California Building Code triggers retrofit requirements when buildings undergo substantial alterations or changes of occupancy.

**Soft-Story Building Program**
- Applies to multi-story buildings with weak ground floors
- Compliance deadlines established by building category
- Penalties for non-compliance including certificate of occupancy restrictions

**Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Program**
