**Room Additions**
Adding living space to Imperial Beach homes requires foundation design, framing engineering, and integration with existing structures.

**ADU Construction**
Accessory Dwelling Units are popular in Imperial Beach for rental income or family housing. ADUs require complete structural design from foundation to roof.

**Deck and Outdoor Living**
Elevated decks, patio covers, and outdoor rooms extend living space in Imperial Beach's pleasant climate but require proper structural support.

**Seismic Retrofits**
Older Imperial Beach homes may benefit from seismic retrofits including foundation bolting, cripple wall bracing, and soft story upgrades.

## Coastal Zone Considerations in Imperial Beach

**Corrosion Resistance**
Salt air accelerates corrosion of metal fasteners and hardware. We specify appropriate galvanized, stainless steel, or coated hardware for coastal durability.

**Coastal Development Permits**
Properties in the Coastal Zone may require Coastal Development Permits adding review requirements to structural projects.

**Flood Zone Requirements**
Some Imperial Beach properties are in flood zones requiring elevated construction or flood-resistant design.

**Soil Conditions**
Coastal and beach-adjacent soils may require special foundation consideration for adequate bearing and resistance to liquefaction.
