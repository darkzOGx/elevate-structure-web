## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is commercial structural engineering different from residential?**
Commercial projects typically involve larger spans, heavier loads, different materials (steel, concrete), more complex code requirements, and different review processes than residential work.

**Do tenant improvements always require structural engineering?**
Not always. Minor changes (paint, flooring, light fixtures) typically don't require engineering. Modifications affecting walls, adding mezzanines, or supporting heavy equipment usually do.

**How long does commercial structural engineering take?**
Timeline varies by project size: tenant improvements often take 2-4 weeks, new construction typically takes 4-8 weeks or more for complex projects.

**Can you work with my architect and contractor?**
Yes. We regularly coordinate with design teams and contractors on commercial projects, providing responsive support throughout design and construction.

**What information do you need to start a commercial project?**
Architectural plans, geotechnical report (for new construction), existing building information (for TI work), and project requirements help us provide accurate proposals and efficient engineering.
