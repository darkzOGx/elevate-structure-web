## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I know if I need a foundation engineer or a geotechnical engineer?**
Geotechnical engineers study soil conditions; structural/foundation engineers design foundations based on that information. For new construction, you typically need both. For foundation problems, start with a structural engineer who will advise if geotechnical investigation is needed.

**Can foundation problems be fixed without replacing the entire foundation?**
Often yes. Many foundation issues can be addressed through underpinning, pier systems, crack repair, or partial replacement without full foundation replacement.

**How long does foundation engineering take?**
Most foundation engineering takes 2-3 weeks, plus Riverside County permit review. Emergency assessments can often be completed faster.

**What's the difference between foundation repair and foundation replacement?**
Repair addresses specific problems (cracks, settlement, water intrusion) while preserving most of the existing foundation. Replacement involves removing and rebuilding the entire foundation—typically only necessary when repair isn't feasible.

**Do you coordinate with contractors on foundation work?**
Yes. We work with your contractor or can recommend experienced foundation contractors familiar with Lake Elsinore conditions.
