## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I know if my foundation cracks are serious?**
Hairline cracks are common and often not structural concerns. Cracks wider than 1/4 inch, stair-step cracks in block, or cracks with vertical displacement warrant professional evaluation. When in doubt, get an assessment.

**What causes foundation problems in Murrieta?**
Expansive clay soils are the most common cause. These soils swell when wet and shrink when dry, creating movement that cracks foundations. Poor drainage and inadequate initial construction also contribute.

**How long does foundation repair take?**
Foundation repairs typically take 3-7 days depending on scope. Engineering assessment and design takes 1-2 weeks. Permit processing varies by jurisdiction—typically 2-4 weeks in Murrieta.
