## Frequently Asked Questions

**What structural systems are typical for business park buildings?**
Common systems include steel frame with metal deck, concrete tilt-up, and wood frame for smaller buildings. System selection depends on building size, tenant requirements, and budget.

**How do medical office buildings differ structurally from standard office?**
Medical facilities require enhanced floor capacity for equipment, provisions for specialized utilities, and careful vibration control for sensitive equipment.

**What is flex space and how is it designed structurally?**
Flex space combines office with warehouse or light industrial use. Structural design provides office-appropriate finishes in front areas with enhanced floor capacity and clear height in warehouse areas.
