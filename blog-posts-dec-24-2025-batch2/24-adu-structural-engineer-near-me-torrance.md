## Why Torrance ADU Projects Need Local Structural Engineers

Torrance has embraced California's ADU legislation, but successful ADU projects require structural engineering that meets both state requirements and local expectations. A local ADU engineer understands Torrance's specific processes and common approval pathways.

**Benefits of Local ADU Expertise:**
- Knowledge of Torrance Development Services Department requirements
- Experience with Torrance's common lot configurations
- Understanding of South Bay construction practices
- Familiarity with typical ADU permit timelines
- Relationships with local ADU contractors

Our [ADU structural engineering](/blog/residential-structural-engineering-guide) team serves Torrance, Redondo Beach, Gardena, and the South Bay.

## What ADU Types Do We Engineer in Torrance?

**Garage Conversion ADUs**
Converting existing garages to living space is the most cost-effective ADU approach. Structural engineering addresses foundation upgrades, wall modifications, and ceiling height requirements.

**Detached ADUs**
New stand-alone ADU buildings require complete structural engineering including foundation design, framing, and connection details.

**Attached ADUs**
ADUs attached to existing homes require structural analysis of connections and load paths to the main house.

**Two-Story ADUs**
Maximizing smaller lots with two-story ADUs requires efficient structural design for both living space and parking below.

**Junior ADUs (JADUs)**
Converting existing living space within homes to independent units may require structural modifications for separate entrances and code compliance.

## How Much Does ADU Structural Engineering Cost in Torrance?

ADU structural engineering in Torrance typically ranges from $3,000 to $8,000 depending on ADU type and complexity.

**Typical ADU Engineering Costs:**
- Garage conversion: $3,000-$5,000
- Detached ADU (single story): $4,000-$6,000
- Detached ADU (two story): $5,000-$7,500
- Attached ADU: $3,500-$5,500
