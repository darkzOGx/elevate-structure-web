## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does large-scale commercial engineering take in San Jose?**
Major commercial buildings typically require 4-8 months from design initiation to permit-ready documents. High-rise towers and complex mixed-use developments may require longer periods. Construction support extends throughout the building phase, typically 2-4 years for major projects.

**What structural systems are used for high-rise buildings in San Jose?**
Common high-rise systems include concrete core walls with outrigger frames, steel special moment frames, concrete special moment frames, and buckling-restrained braced frames. System selection depends on building height, configuration, and performance objectives. Performance-based design enables optimization for specific project requirements.

**What is performance-based seismic design and when is it required?**
Performance-based design uses sophisticated analysis to demonstrate building performance under expected earthquakes, potentially allowing optimization compared to prescriptive code requirements. It's typically required for buildings over 160 feet or may be elected to achieve design goals. Costs include additional engineering and peer review.

**How do mixed-use buildings affect structural engineering complexity?**
Mixed-use buildings require coordination of different structural grids (parking typically 60' columns, residential 25-30' spans, office flexible), transfer structures at use transitions, and different loading requirements. Early coordination among all uses is essential for efficient structure.

**What are typical foundation systems for large buildings in San Jose?**
Large buildings typically use deep foundations—driven piles or drilled shafts bearing on competent materials below variable surface soils. Mat foundations are used where bearing conditions allow. Foundation selection depends on building loads, soil conditions, and groundwater, established through geotechnical investigation.
