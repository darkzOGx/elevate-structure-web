## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I verify a structural engineer's license in California?**
Visit the Board for Professional Engineers website (bpelsg.ca.gov) and use the license lookup tool. Enter the engineer's name or license number to verify active status.

**What's the difference between a structural engineer and an architect?**

Residential projects typically take 2-4 weeks from initial meeting to permit-ready documents. Commercial projects may take 4-8 weeks or longer depending on complexity.
