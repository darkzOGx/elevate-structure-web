## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is someone really available 24 hours a day?

Yes. Our 24-hour line connects you with either an engineer directly or a trained coordinator who can assess urgency and dispatch appropriate response. For true emergencies, engineers are available to respond on-site any hour of the day or night, including weekends and holidays.

### How much more expensive is after-hours service?

After-hours service typically carries a 50-100% premium over standard business hours rates. This reflects engineer availability, response time commitments, and the nature of emergency work. Most property owners find this reasonable given the alternative of waiting with uncertain structural conditions.

### What areas do you cover with 24-hour service?

Our 24-hour coverage includes all of Riverside County and San Bernardino County, with focus on the Inland Empire region. This includes Moreno Valley, Riverside, Corona, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, and surrounding communities. For locations outside our primary area, we can often still respond or help identify local resources.

### Should I call at night or wait until morning?

If there's any concern about immediate safety, call immediately. Signs of active structural movement, visible failures, or conditions that might worsen should not wait. If you're simply uncertain about a condition and there's no immediate danger, you can call and discuss—we'll help you determine whether immediate response is warranted.

### What should I do while waiting for the engineer?

Ensure everyone's safety first—evacuate if there's any doubt about structural integrity. Don't attempt repairs or propping of damaged areas. Document conditions with photos if safe to do so. Have building access ready for the engineer. Gather any relevant documents (plans, previous reports) if easily accessible.
