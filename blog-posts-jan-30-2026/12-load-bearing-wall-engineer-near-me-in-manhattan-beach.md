Load bearing walls carry weight from the roof and floors above down to the foundation. Removing them without proper engineering can cause:
- Sagging ceilings and rooflines
- Cracked drywall and finishes
- Structural failure in severe cases
- Foundation stress and damage

**How to Identify Load Bearing Walls:**
- Walls running perpendicular to floor joists
- Walls directly below roof ridges
- Walls stacked above each other on multiple floors
- Original exterior walls
- Walls with posts or beams above

**When You Need an Engineer:**
- Any wall removal during remodeling
- Creating open floor plans
- Kitchen and living room combinations
- Opening up hallways and entries
- Second-story additions requiring wall modifications

### What Does a Load Bearing Wall Engineer Do?

**Assessment Phase:**
- Visit your Manhattan Beach property
- Examine wall construction and framing
- Determine if wall carries structural loads
- Identify loads the wall supports

**Design Phase:**
- Calculate loads requiring support
- Design beam and post system
- Specify connections and hardware
- Determine foundation requirements

**Documentation:**
- Prepare PE-stamped structural plans
- Provide specifications for contractor

## Load Bearing Wall Engineer Near Me Manhattan Beach FAQs

### How do I find a load bearing wall engineer near me in Manhattan Beach?

To find a qualified load bearing wall engineer near you in Manhattan Beach, look for California PE-licensed structural engineers with residential remodeling experience. Verify their license at bpelsg.ca.gov, ask about Manhattan Beach project experience, and request references. AAA Engineering Design serves Manhattan Beach and the South Bay with PE-licensed wall removal engineering.

### How much does it cost to have an engineer assess a load bearing wall?

Load bearing wall assessment and engineering in Manhattan Beach typically costs $1,500-$5,000 depending on complexity. A simple assessment to determine if a wall is load bearing costs $500-$1,000. Full beam design for wall removal ranges $1,500-$3,500 for standard projects, with complex multi-wall or multi-story projects costing more.

### Do I need an engineer to remove a load bearing wall in Manhattan Beach?

Yes, Manhattan Beach requires PE-stamped structural plans for any load bearing wall removal. California Building Code requires engineering analysis to design replacement support systems. Removing a load bearing wall without proper engineering risks structural damage and is not permitted by the City.

### How long does load bearing wall engineering take?

Load bearing wall engineering typically takes 1-2 weeks for design, plus 2-3 weeks for Manhattan Beach plan check. Simple single-wall projects may complete faster. Total time from first call to permit approval is typically 5-8 weeks, depending on project complexity and any plan check corrections needed.

### Can any wall be removed with the right engineering?

Most load bearing walls can be safely removed with proper engineering design. The engineer designs beams and posts to carry the loads previously supported by the wall. Limitations may include: very long spans requiring very large beams, foundation capacity for new point loads, and practical ceiling height considerations. Your engineer will advise on feasibility.

### What's the difference between a flush beam and a dropped beam?

A flush beam is installed within the ceiling framing, maintaining a flat ceiling. It requires more complex framing and may need a deeper beam. A dropped beam hangs below the ceiling level, is simpler to install, and can become a design feature. Your engineer and architect will recommend the best option for your Manhattan Beach project.
