## Restaurant Structural Engineering in Beverly Hills FAQs

### How long does restaurant engineering take in Beverly Hills?

Restaurant structural engineering in Beverly Hills typically takes 4-8 weeks for design and documentation, depending on project complexity. Simple tenant improvements may complete in 3-4 weeks. Projects involving historic buildings, outdoor dining additions, or design review may require 8-12 weeks. Add 4-8 weeks for Beverly Hills building permit review. Design review adds additional time depending on complexity.

### Does my Beverly Hills restaurant need design review?

Most Beverly Hills restaurant projects require some level of design review. New construction, exterior modifications, outdoor dining structures, and signage changes definitely require review. Interior-only tenant improvements may have simplified review or exemption. Contact the Beverly Hills Community Development Department early in your project to determine requirements for your specific location and scope.

### Can I install a commercial pizza oven in an existing building?

Commercial pizza ovens weighing 2,000-10,000+ lbs can be installed in existing Beverly Hills buildings with proper structural engineering. Requirements include: floor capacity verification and reinforcement if needed, appropriate foundation or support design, exhaust hood and flue coordination, and fire rating considerations. Upper floor installations are possible but more complex. A structural assessment determines feasibility and requirements.

### What structural requirements exist for rooftop dining in Beverly Hills?

Rooftop dining in Beverly Hills requires: structural verification that roof can support occupancy loads (100 psf minimum), guardrails at edges (42" minimum height, proper load capacity), egress compliance for occupant capacity, acoustic and noise considerations, and HVAC/ventilation coordination. Historic buildings may have additional preservation requirements. Engineering evaluation determines specific scope.

### How much floor load is needed for a commercial kitchen?

Commercial kitchen floor load requirements depend on equipment: general kitchen areas need 100-150 psf, heavy equipment zones need 200-300 psf, walk-in cooler areas need 100 psf plus refrigeration loads, and specialty equipment (pizza ovens, etc.) may impose point loads of 5,000-10,000+ lbs. Standard commercial buildings (50-100 psf design) typically require reinforcement for full kitchen use.

### Can outdoor dining be added to my Beverly Hills restaurant?

Outdoor dining can be added to most Beverly Hills restaurants subject to: sidewalk café permit for public right-of-way use, design review for structures and fixtures, accessibility compliance, clearance and pathway requirements, and structural design for shade structures or enclosures. Beverly Hills has specific aesthetic and operational requirements for outdoor dining. Early consultation with the city planning department is recommended.
