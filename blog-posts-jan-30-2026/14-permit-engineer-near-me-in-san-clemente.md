### How much does permit engineering cost in San Clemente?

Permit engineering in San Clemente typically costs $1,500-$10,000+ depending on project scope. Simple structures like patio covers run $1,500-$3,000, room additions $3,000-$6,000, ADUs $5,000-$10,000, and custom homes $15,000-$40,000. Coastal and hillside projects may cost more due to additional complexity.

### How long does the San Clemente permit process take?

San Clemente permit timelines vary significantly. Standard projects take 8-12 weeks (2-4 weeks engineering, 3-6 weeks plan check, plus corrections). Projects requiring Coastal Development Permits may take 4-12+ weeks additional. Hillside projects with geotechnical requirements may also extend timelines.

### Do I need a Coastal Development Permit in San Clemente?

Most of San Clemente is within the Coastal Zone, so many projects require Coastal Development Permits. Generally needed for: new construction, additions, significant remodels, pools, decks, and accessory structures. Minor projects may qualify for exemptions. Your permit engineer can help determine requirements.

### What's the difference between a permit engineer and an architect?

A permit engineer (structural engineer) focuses on structural safety—foundations, framing, connections, and load calculations. An architect focuses on overall design, space planning, aesthetics, and code compliance beyond structural. Most permit projects need both: architect for design and PE engineer for structural plans. Some simple projects may need only engineering.

### Why do San Clemente permits take longer?

San Clemente permits often take longer due to: Coastal Zone requirements adding permit layers, hillside development standards requiring additional review, Spanish Village architectural considerations, and coordination between City and Coastal Commission. Working with experienced local professionals helps minimize delays.
