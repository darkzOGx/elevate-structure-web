## Frequently Asked Questions

### What constitutes a structural emergency?

A structural emergency exists when there's potential for imminent collapse, when occupant safety may be compromised, or when delay could result in significantly worse damage. Signs include sudden cracking with ongoing movement, visible structural member failure, foundation shifting, or building department posting. When in doubt, call for professional guidance.

### How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Encinitas?

For true emergencies, we typically provide on-site response within 1-3 hours during daytime and 2-4 hours for after-hours calls. Our engineers live and work throughout San Diego County, enabling rapid response to North County coastal communities including Encinitas, Carlsbad, and Solana Beach.

### What should I do while waiting for the engineer?

Evacuate if there's any doubt about safety. Don't attempt to prop up or repair structural damage yourself. Document conditions with photos if safe to do so. Shut off utilities if there's potential for gas leaks or electrical hazards. Keep people away from damaged areas. Contact your insurance company to begin the claims process.

### Will my insurance cover emergency structural assessment?

Most property insurance policies cover professional assessment costs when damage results from covered events. Emergency assessment is typically included in overall claim settlements. We provide documentation specifically formatted for insurance purposes. Contact your insurance company early in the process to understand your specific coverage.

### Can you help remove a red tag from my property?

Yes, we regularly assist property owners in addressing red tag postings. This involves comprehensive assessment, design of necessary repairs, permit application, construction observation, and coordination with inspectors for final sign-off. Timeline depends on damage extent and repair complexity.
