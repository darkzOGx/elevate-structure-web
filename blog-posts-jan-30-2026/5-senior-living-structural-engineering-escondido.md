## What is Senior Living Facility Structural Engineering?

Senior living facility structural engineering involves the specialized design of buildings that house elderly residents requiring varying levels of care. In Escondido, where the aging population continues to grow, these facilities must meet stringent California healthcare construction standards while providing comfortable, safe living environments.

The structural challenges include designing for accessibility throughout, integrating complex mechanical systems, and creating homelike environments within institutional code requirements. Our engineers at AAA Engineering Design understand these unique demands.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do senior living facilities require OSHPD approval?

Independent and assisted living facilities typically do not require OSHPD review—they use local building department permitting. Skilled nursing facilities (SNF) with licensed beds require OSHPD 3 plan review and approval, adding significant time and cost to the permitting process.

### What seismic requirements apply to senior living in Escondido?

Escondido requires Seismic Design Category D design for all buildings. Skilled nursing facilities are classified as essential facilities requiring enhanced seismic design factors. Our engineers design systems that exceed minimum requirements for resident safety.

### How do I design for future expansion?

Expansion planning includes designing foundations for additional wings, leaving structural connections at building ends, and sizing mechanical systems for future loads. We document expansion provisions in construction drawings for streamlined future permits.

### What floor loads should I design for in senior living?

Resident rooms require 40 PSF minimum. Common areas and dining rooms need 100 PSF. Commercial kitchens require 150 PSF. We design for specific equipment loads at their actual locations while maintaining general minimums throughout.

### How long does senior living permitting take in Escondido?

Standard assisted living facilities take 6-8 weeks for City of Escondido plan review. Skilled nursing facilities requiring OSHPD approval take 12-16 weeks or longer. Our team's healthcare experience helps minimize review cycles.
