## What Is Garage Conversion Engineering in San Bernardino?

Garage conversion engineering involves designing the structural modifications required to transform attached or detached garages into habitable living space or ADUs. In San Bernardino, where affordable housing is in demand and California ADU laws have streamlined conversion processes, garage conversions offer cost-effective ways to add living space. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of experience design garage conversions throughout San Bernardino and the Inland Empire.

San Bernardino's housing market makes garage conversions particularly attractive. Converting a garage to an ADU can generate $1,500-$2,500/month in rental income, providing valuable income for homeowners while addressing the region's housing needs.

## What Structural Changes Are Required for Garage Conversions in San Bernardino?

Garage conversions in San Bernardino require structural modifications including foundation upgrades, front wall replacement, egress window installation, and lateral bracing modifications. Our licensed Professional Engineers design complete conversion packages addressing all structural requirements.

**Foundation Requirements**

**Upgrading for Living Space:**
Most garage slabs were designed for vehicle loads, not continuous occupancy:
- Slab thickness verification
- Stem wall height check (raised floor may be needed)
- Moisture barrier installation
- Possible foundation supplementation

**San Bernardino Consideration:**
Expansive soils in many San Bernardino areas may require enhanced foundation measures.

**Front Wall Replacement**

**Converting the Garage Door Opening:**
The garage door opening must be converted to standard wall:
- Stud wall framing
- Window and door installation
- Shear panel or bracing
- Weather barrier completion

**Egress Requirements**

**Emergency Exit Windows:**
Living spaces require emergency egress:
- Minimum 5.7 SF opening
- Maximum 44" sill height
- Specific width and height requirements
- Direct exterior access

**Lateral Bracing**

**Seismic Resistance:**
Garage conversions often require lateral system modifications:
- Shear wall additions
- Hold-down connections
- Anchor bolt upgrades
- Roof-to-wall connections

**Engineering Costs**

## What Are Common Garage Conversion Challenges in San Bernardino?

Common San Bernardino garage conversion challenges include low ceiling heights, inadequate foundations, lack of natural light, and coordination with existing utility services. Our engineers develop solutions for each site's specific conditions.

**Challenge 1: Low Ceiling Height**

**Problem:** Many garages have 7-8 foot ceilings, below the 7'6" code minimum for habitable space.

**Solution:** Raised floor with stepped entry, or assess feasibility of raising roof structure.

**Challenge 2: Foundation Issues**

**Problem:** Garage slabs may be too thin, cracked, or lacking proper moisture protection.

**San Bernardino Solution:**
- Overlay with new concrete if needed
- Install vapor barrier and insulation
- Add raised floor system for grade issues

**Challenge 3: Heating/Cooling**

**Problem:** San Bernardino's hot summers require adequate HVAC for converted spaces.

**Solution:** Design accommodates ductwork, mini-splits, or other HVAC solutions with proper structural support.
