## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I find a foundation repair engineer near me in Moreno Valley?**
Look for a California-licensed PE with Inland Empire experience. Avoid engineers affiliated with repair companies—independent assessment ensures objectivity.

**What causes foundation problems in Moreno Valley?**
Most Moreno Valley foundation problems result from expansive clay soils that swell when wet and shrink when dry, causing seasonal foundation movement.

**How do I know if my foundation needs repair?**
Signs include diagonal wall cracks, sticking doors/windows, sloping floors, and exterior foundation cracking. Professional assessment determines repair need.

**Is foundation damage covered by insurance?**
Standard homeowner's insurance typically excludes earth movement. Some damage may be covered if caused by plumbing leaks. Our reports help document claims.

**How long do foundation repairs last?**
Properly designed and installed underpinning (push piers, helical piers) provides permanent stabilization by bypassing problematic surface soils.

**Should I get an assessment before selling my Moreno Valley home?**
Pre-sale assessment identifies issues before buyers discover them, allowing you to address problems or disclose with documentation.
