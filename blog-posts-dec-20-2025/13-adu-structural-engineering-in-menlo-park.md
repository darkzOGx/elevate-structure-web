## What Is ADU Structural Engineering in Menlo Park?

ADU structural engineering involves designing the structural systems for accessory dwelling units—including foundations, framing, and connections—to meet California Building Code requirements and local Menlo Park regulations. In Menlo Park, where property values and rental demand make ADUs exceptionally valuable investments, professional engineering ensures projects achieve permits efficiently and perform long-term. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of experience design ADU structures throughout Menlo Park, Atherton, and the San Francisco Peninsula.

Menlo Park's position at the heart of Silicon Valley creates unique ADU dynamics. With median home values exceeding $3 million, ADU investments of $150,000-$400,000 represent sound financial decisions given rental income potential and property value enhancement.

## What ADU Types Require Structural Engineering in Menlo Park?

All ADU types in Menlo Park require structural engineering including detached ADUs, garage conversions, attached additions, and junior ADUs. Our licensed Professional Engineers provide complete structural design for each ADU type, addressing specific challenges of each configuration.

**Detached ADUs**

**New Construction on Your Property**
Detached ADUs require complete structural design:
- Foundation system design
- Wall framing and lateral resistance
- Roof structure
- Connection details

**Menlo Park Considerations:**
Detached ADUs must comply with setback requirements and height limits while maximizing usable space on Menlo Park's typically modest lot sizes.

**Garage Conversions**

**Transforming Existing Structures**
Converting garages to living space requires:
- Foundation evaluation/upgrade
- Front wall replacement (former door opening)
- Egress window installation
- Lateral bracing modifications

**Common Menlo Park Challenge:**
Many Menlo Park garages have inadequate foundations for living space loads, requiring foundation enhancement.

**Attached ADUs**

**Additions to Existing Homes**
Attached ADUs require connection to existing structure:
- Integration with existing foundation
- Match existing roof lines
- Wall connection detailing
- Seismic load path continuity

**Junior ADUs (JADUs)**

**Within Existing Living Space**
JADUs up to 500 SF require:
- Code compliance verification
- Egress requirements
- Fire separation if applicable
- Minimal structural modifications typically

## How Does ADU Structural Engineering Work in Menlo Park?

ADU structural engineering typically takes 3-5 weeks from initial consultation to permit-ready plans. Our licensed Professional Engineers coordinate with architects, designers, and the City of Menlo Park to develop complete structural designs that navigate the approval process efficiently.

**Phase 1: Existing Conditions (Week 1)**

**Understanding Your Site:**
- Property survey review
- Existing structure evaluation
- Geotechnical considerations
- Utility locations

**Menlo Park Specifics:**
We review Menlo Park's ADU regulations including setbacks, height limits, and parking requirements that influence structural design.

**Phase 2: Structural Design (Week 1-3)**

**Design Components:**
- Foundation design
- Wall framing layout
- Roof structure
- Lateral resistance system
- Connection details

**Phase 3: Plan Preparation (Week 3-5)**

**Permit-Ready Documents:**
- Structural plans
- Foundation details
- Framing specifications
- Calculation package
- PE stamp and certification
