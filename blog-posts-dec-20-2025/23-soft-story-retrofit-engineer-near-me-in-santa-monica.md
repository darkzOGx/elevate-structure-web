## Looking for a Soft-Story Retrofit Engineer Near You in Santa Monica?

Finding a qualified soft-story retrofit engineer near you in Santa Monica is urgent for property owners subject to the city's mandatory seismic retrofit ordinance. With compliance deadlines affecting hundreds of apartment buildings and significant penalties for non-compliance, professional engineering expertise is essential. AAA Engineering Design serves Santa Monica property owners with expert soft-story retrofit design that meets mandatory requirements while minimizing cost and tenant disruption.

Santa Monica's classic apartment building stock—2-3 story buildings with ground-floor parking built from the 1950s-1970s—creates the soft-story vulnerability that the city's retrofit ordinance targets. These buildings, concentrated in neighborhoods like Mid-City and Wilshire Montana, require professional engineering to achieve compliance.

## Why Santa Monica Property Owners Need Soft-Story Retrofit Engineers

Santa Monica property owners need soft-story retrofit engineers because the city's mandatory seismic retrofit ordinance requires professional engineering design and PE-stamped construction documents for compliance. Non-compliance triggers penalties and property restrictions.

**Mandatory Ordinance Requirements**

Santa Monica's ordinance requires:
- Professional engineering evaluation
- PE-stamped retrofit design
- City permit approval
- Completed construction
- Final inspection certification

**Compliance Deadlines**

The ordinance established phased deadlines:
- Tier 1 buildings: Earliest deadlines
- Tier 2 buildings: Later deadlines
- Check current status with Santa Monica Building & Safety

**Non-Compliance Consequences**

Failure to comply results in:
- Daily fines exceeding $1,000
- Rent restriction limitations
- Sale and refinancing obstacles
- Potential condemnation risk
