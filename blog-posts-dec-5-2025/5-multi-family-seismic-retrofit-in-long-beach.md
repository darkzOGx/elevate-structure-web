Multi-family seismic retrofit in Long Beach is no longer optional for many building owners—it's a mandatory requirement under the city's seismic retrofit ordinance targeting vulnerable soft-story and pre-Northridge construction. Our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with over 20 years of combined experience have completed 200+ seismic retrofit projects throughout Los Angeles County, helping multi-family property owners meet compliance deadlines while optimizing costs. With Long Beach's retrofit ordinance in full enforcement, property owners face real consequences for non-compliance including daily fines, restricted property transfers, and insurance complications.

Long Beach's diverse building stock—from historic downtown apartments to 1960s garden-style complexes—presents varying retrofit challenges. Whether you own a 4-unit building in Belmont Shore or a 50-unit complex in North Long Beach, understanding your retrofit requirements is essential for protecting both your tenants and your investment.

## What Is Multi-Family Seismic Retrofit?

**Direct Answer:**
Multi-family seismic retrofit is the structural strengthening of apartment buildings, condominiums, and multi-unit housing to improve earthquake performance. In California, retrofits typically address soft-story conditions (weak first floors), inadequate foundation connections, and non-ductile concrete frames using steel moment frames, plywood shearwalls, foundation bolting, and cripple wall bracing. Licensed Professional Engineers design these systems to meet current California Building Code seismic standards.

Common multi-family retrofit elements include:
- **Soft-story strengthening**: Steel frames or plywood walls at ground level
- **Foundation connections**: Anchor bolts and hold-downs
- **Cripple wall bracing**: Short wood stud walls below first floor
- **Concrete strengthening**: Carbon fiber or steel jacketing
- **Collector and drag strut addition**: Load path completion

Long Beach's ordinance specifically targets wood-frame soft-story buildings that pose the greatest collapse risk. Our [structural engineering services](/services/structural-engineering) include complete retrofit design and construction support.

## What Are Long Beach's Seismic Retrofit Requirements?

**Direct Answer:**
Long Beach's seismic retrofit ordinance requires owners of soft-story buildings (3+ stories with ground-floor parking or commercial space) to complete structural retrofits by specified deadlines. The city maintains a mandatory retrofit list, issues compliance notices, and enforces escalating penalties for non-compliance including daily fines up to $1,000+ and restrictions on property transfers.

### Buildings Subject to Ordinance

**Mandatory Retrofit Criteria:**
- Wood-frame construction
- Three or more stories
- Ground floor with:
  - Open parking (tuck-under)
  - Commercial space with large openings
  - Other soft-story conditions
- Built before 1978 (typically)

**Exemptions:**
- Buildings with prior retrofits meeting current standards
- Structures with demonstrated adequate lateral resistance
- Buildings scheduled for demolition (with proof)

### Compliance Timeline

**Long Beach Soft-Story Program:**
| Phase | Building Type | Deadline Status |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | 16+ units | Deadlines passed |
| Phase 2 | 7-15 units | Deadlines passed |
| Phase 3 | 3-6 units | Some approaching |

**Current Status (2025):**
Many Long Beach soft-story buildings are now past their compliance deadlines. Properties in non-compliance face active enforcement. Contact the Long Beach Building Department for your specific building's status.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

**Enforcement Actions:**
- Daily fines ($100-$1,000+ per day)
- Public posting of non-compliance
- Recorded notice on property title
- Restrictions on tenant occupancy changes
- Insurance and lending complications
- Personal liability exposure for owners

## What Types of Multi-Family Buildings Need Retrofit in Long Beach?

**Direct Answer:**
Long Beach's diverse housing stock includes several building types commonly requiring retrofit: 1950s-1970s tuck-under apartment buildings, dingbat apartments with ground-floor parking, older courtyard buildings with unreinforced masonry, and post-war garden apartments with open carports. Each type presents distinct structural conditions requiring tailored engineering approaches.

### Tuck-Under Apartment Buildings

**Characteristics:**
- 2-4 stories
- Ground floor parking beneath residential units
- Large garage door openings
- Minimal shearwalls at ground level
- Built 1950s-1970s predominantly

**Retrofit Approach:**
- Steel moment frames in parking area
- New plywood shearwalls where possible
- Enhanced foundation connections
- Collector straps at floor diaphragms

**Long Beach Prevalence:**
Very common in Belmont Shore, Belmont Heights, Alamitos Beach, and downtown areas.

### Dingbat Apartments

**Characteristics:**
- Boxy 2-3 story design
- Ground floor entirely parking
- Minimal architectural ornamentation
- Built 1950s-1960s
- 4-12 units typical

**Retrofit Challenges:**
- Limited parking space for steel frames
- Maintaining parking capacity during retrofit
- Minimal existing lateral system
- Often deferred maintenance issues

**Long Beach Prevalence:**
Found throughout central Long Beach neighborhoods.

### Garden-Style Apartments

**Characteristics:**
- 2-3 stories
- Open carports adjacent to buildings
- Multiple buildings per property
- Courtyard or landscaped common areas
- Built 1960s-1970s

**Retrofit Considerations:**
- Multiple buildings increase scope
- Carport retrofits may be included
- Site drainage coordination
- Phased construction for tenant access

### Historic/Older Construction

**Characteristics:**
- Built pre-1940
- Unreinforced masonry (URM) in some cases
- Unique construction methods
- Preservation concerns
- Often in historic districts

**Long Beach Examples:**
- Downtown historic apartments
- East Village Arts District buildings
- Pine Avenue corridor structures

**Retrofit Approach:**
- URM anchorage and bracing
- Preservation-sensitive methods
- Historic review compliance
- Seismic-resistant connections

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if my building is on the mandatory retrofit list?

Contact the Long Beach Building & Safety Division at (562) 570-6651 or check online at longbeach.gov. The city maintains a list of buildings subject to the soft-story ordinance. If you've received a compliance notice, your building is definitely on the list.

### What happens if I miss my compliance deadline?

Non-compliant buildings face escalating daily fines, public posting of non-compliance status, restrictions on rental increases, and recorded notices on property title affecting sale and refinance. Continued non-compliance may result in red-tagging and required tenant relocation at owner expense.

### Can retrofit costs be passed through to tenants?

In Long Beach rent-controlled buildings, owners may petition for capital improvement pass-through of seismic retrofit costs, subject to LBHD regulations limiting monthly increases. Non-rent-controlled properties have more flexibility. Consult with an attorney regarding your specific situation.

### How long do tenants need to relocate during retrofit?

Most soft-story retrofits can be completed with minimal tenant displacement—often allowing continued occupancy with temporary parking changes. Some buildings may require brief unit-by-unit work causing 1-2 day relocations per unit. Major retrofits may require longer displacement with corresponding tenant protections.

### Does retrofit affect my property insurance?

Retrofitted buildings typically qualify for better insurance rates and easier policy placement. Non-compliant buildings may face coverage restrictions, higher premiums, or difficulty obtaining insurance. Many insurers now require proof of ordinance compliance.

### Can I sell a non-compliant building?

Yes, but buyers must be notified of retrofit requirements, and lenders may require compliance or escrow holdbacks. Non-compliance affects property value and limits buyer pool. Some investors specifically acquire non-compliant buildings at discount, factoring retrofit costs into purchase price.
