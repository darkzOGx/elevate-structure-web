Irvine is Orange County's commercial real estate engine. The city hosts more than 15 million square feet of office space, 8 million square feet of industrial space, and a rapidly growing retail and mixed-use inventory. Every time a commercial tenant moves in — or moves out — the space gets reconfigured. Load-bearing walls get removed to create open floor plans. Mezzanines get added to create bonus square footage. HVAC equipment gets relocated, requiring structural penetrations through roof framing. These modifications require a structural engineer.

Irvine's commercial building stock includes Type II and Type III construction from the 1970s and 1980s as well as new Type I concrete and steel structures in the Irvine Spectrum and Great Park areas. The structural systems vary widely — concrete tilt-up panels, steel moment frames, wood-frame office buildings, pre-engineered metal buildings — and the engineering approach for tenant improvements differs significantly across building types. AAA Engineering Design has provided commercial tenant improvement structural engineering across Irvine's full range of commercial building types for over a decade.

## What Is a Commercial Tenant Improvement Structural Engineer?

A commercial tenant improvement (TI) structural engineer is a California-licensed Professional Engineer who designs and certifies the structural modifications required when a commercial space is reconfigured for a new tenant or use. The TI structural engineer works alongside the tenant's architect and contractor to ensure that load-bearing wall removals, new openings, mezzanine additions, HVAC penetrations, and other structural modifications comply with the California Building Code (CBC 2022) and the City of Irvine's building standards.

Every structural modification to a commercial building in Irvine requires a building permit with stamped structural drawings from a California PE. The structural engineer is responsible for verifying that existing structural systems are adequate for the proposed modifications and for designing remediation where they are not. Without proper structural engineering, commercial tenants face permit denials, stop-work orders, structural failures, and substantial liability under California commercial lease terms.

The scope of TI structural engineering depends on the nature of the modifications. Simple projects — a single non-load-bearing wall removal, two to three rooftop HVAC penetrations — require minimal engineering. Complex projects — full floor plan reconfiguration with multiple load-bearing wall removals, addition of a mezzanine, installation of heavy industrial equipment — require detailed analysis of the entire structural system.

## What TI Structural Engineering Services Are Available in Irvine?

Irvine commercial tenants and landlords have access to a complete range of tenant improvement structural engineering services from AAA Engineering Design.

**Load-Bearing Wall Modification for Commercial Spaces.** The most frequent TI structural request is removing or relocating interior walls to create open floor plans for modern office layouts, retail spaces, or restaurant configurations. When walls are structural — carrying floor or roof loads — removal requires engineering analysis to verify existing loads, design replacement transfer beams and columns, and ensure load continuity to the foundation. AAA Engineering designs beam and column systems using steel, wood, or concrete to match the existing building's structural system and construction type.

**Open Floor Plan Conversion for Office and Retail.** Irvine's corporate tenants — technology companies, financial services firms, healthcare organizations — consistently demand open, column-free floor plans. Converting existing office or retail spaces with internal columns and full-height partitions to open plans requires systematic structural analysis of the entire gravity and lateral systems. AAA Engineering evaluates which walls are structural, designs transfer beams and columns for each removal, and coordinates the sequence of demolition and shoring to maintain structural safety during construction.

**HVAC Opening Reinforcement.** Rooftop HVAC units require structural penetrations through roof framing — typically 24 to 48 inch openings in roof joists, purlins, or decking. Each penetration interrupts structural members that carry gravity loads and contribute to roof diaphragm action. AAA Engineering designs header and trimmer systems that reinforce each opening, maintains diaphragm continuity, and ensures that rooftop equipment loads are transferred to the primary framing. We also design equipment pads and curbing for rooftop unit installations.

**Mezzanine Design.** Adding a mezzanine level within a commercial space increases usable square footage without extending the building footprint — a cost-effective solution in Irvine's high-value commercial market. AAA Engineering designs free-standing steel mezzanine structures that meet CBC 2022 live load requirements (100 psf for storage, 50 psf for office), seismic requirements for Irvine's Seismic Design Category D, and ADA accessibility requirements including stair and guardrail design. Our mezzanine designs minimize column count to preserve floor-level usability.

**ADA Compliance Structural Changes.** The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California Building Code (CBC Chapter 11B) require specific structural provisions for accessible routes, restroom facilities, service counters, and entrance configurations. TI projects in Irvine frequently require structural work to support ADA ramp systems, to reinforce restroom walls for grab bar installation, and to lower countertops and service windows to accessible heights. AAA Engineering designs structural support for all ADA compliance modifications.

**Heavy Equipment and Racking Support.** Industrial tenants in Irvine's Spectrum and Business Complex areas frequently install heavy equipment — manufacturing machinery, server racks, high-density storage systems — that exceed floor live load design values. AAA Engineering evaluates existing floor system capacity, designs reinforced floor sections or grade beams for point loads, and provides equipment anchorage designs complying with CBC 2022 seismic requirements.

Our [commercial structural engineering services](/services/commercial) and [structural engineering services](/services/structural-engineering) cover the full range of Irvine commercial TI projects.

## How Does the TI Structural Engineering Process Work in California?

The commercial TI structural engineering process in California follows a sequence established by the CBC 2022 and the City of Irvine Building Division's requirements.

**Step 1: Existing Building Record Review (Week 1).** AAA Engineering requests and reviews the building's existing structural drawings from the City of Irvine Building Division or the building owner's records. Original structural drawings provide the foundation for TI design — without them, AAA Engineering conducts field measurements and a structural investigation to develop an as-built record. In Irvine's commercial core, most buildings from 1985 onward have drawings on file with the city.

**Step 2: Structural Assessment and Load Verification (Weeks 1-2).** With existing records in hand, AAA Engineering conducts a field visit to verify as-built conditions and assess structural adequacy for the proposed modifications. We identify load-bearing elements to be removed or modified, verify existing framing sizes and conditions, and evaluate the lateral system to confirm it can accommodate the proposed changes.

**Step 3: TI Structural Design (Weeks 2-4).** AAA Engineering develops the structural design for all proposed modifications. This includes transfer beam and column sizing for wall removals, header and trimmer design for roof penetrations, mezzanine structural design (if applicable), and any required foundation upgrades. We use current CBC 2022 load combinations and seismic design requirements for Irvine's location in Seismic Zone 4.

**Step 4: Permit Package Preparation (Weeks 3-5).** Our drafting team produces permit-ready structural drawings coordinated with the TI architect's drawings. Packages include floor plan markups showing structural modifications, structural details for each modification type, revised roof plan showing HVAC penetration locations, and structural calculations. All drawings carry the California PE's wet stamp.

**Step 5: City of Irvine Plan Check (Weeks 5-9).** TI permits in Irvine are processed by the Building Division. Standard plan check turnaround is 3 to 6 weeks for over-the-counter review and 4 to 8 weeks for standard review. AAA Engineering responds to plan check corrections promptly.

**Step 6: Construction Observation.** During construction, AAA Engineering provides structural observation at key milestones — shoring installation, beam installation, post-installation of mezzanine columns — and responds to contractor RFIs within 24 hours.

## What Are the Regional Considerations for Irvine?

Irvine's commercial structural environment has characteristics that distinguish it from other Orange County markets.

**Concrete Tilt-Up Construction Prevalence.** A large fraction of Irvine's industrial and light commercial buildings from the 1970s through 1990s are concrete tilt-up construction — large precast concrete wall panels erected vertically at the building perimeter, with a steel roof structure spanning between them. Tilt-up buildings have specific structural considerations for TI work: wall penetrations require careful engineering to preserve panel structural integrity, mezzanine columns must be designed to transfer loads to the slab without overloading the tilt-up panels, and lateral system modifications must preserve the tilt-up panels' function as shear elements. AAA Engineering has extensive experience with tilt-up TI projects.

**Pre-Engineered Metal Buildings.** Many Irvine Business Complex buildings are pre-engineered metal buildings (PEMB) — light steel structures designed by the original fabricator. PEMB modifications require obtaining the original fabricator's design data or performing independent engineering analysis to verify that modifications are compatible with the original design intent. AAA Engineering conducts PEMB modification analysis and coordinates with original fabricators when needed.

**Seismic Design Category D Requirements.** Irvine is assigned Seismic Design Category D under CBC 2022. TI projects that materially alter the building's structural system — including mezzanine additions, major wall removals, and significant load redistribution — trigger seismic upgrade requirements under CBC 2022 Section 3403. AAA Engineering evaluates upgrade trigger thresholds at project outset to help clients understand their seismic compliance obligations.

**City of Irvine Building Division Procedures.** The City of Irvine Building Division is known for efficient, professional plan check services. Online permit application is available for standard TI projects. Irvine accepts third-party plan check from approved providers for qualified projects, accelerating turnaround to 5 to 10 business days. AAA Engineering works with Irvine's approved third-party reviewers to minimize permit timelines for time-sensitive TI projects.

**Neighboring Market Comparisons.** Costa Mesa's commercial buildings include a mix of construction types similar to Irvine, with the addition of older 1960s concrete frame buildings near the SNA airport corridor. Tustin has significant older industrial stock with different seismic performance characteristics. Santa Ana's commercial buildings include a large fraction of pre-1980 construction with limited seismic detailing. Newport Beach commercial buildings in the Fashion Island and airport area are typically higher-quality construction with complete structural documentation on file. Lake Forest's commercial properties include substantial tilt-up and PEMB inventory similar to Irvine's Business Complex. AAA Engineering serves all of these Orange County markets.

## How Do You Select the Right TI Structural Engineer in Irvine?

Selecting the right structural engineer for an Irvine commercial TI project determines whether the project stays on schedule and budget.

**California PE with Commercial Building Experience.** Verify California PE licensure at dca.ca.gov. Beyond licensure, confirm that the engineer has specific experience with commercial building types prevalent in Irvine — tilt-up, PEMB, steel moment frame, and concrete frame construction. Engineers who specialize in residential or custom projects lack the commercial building expertise for Irvine TI work.

**City of Irvine Building Division Familiarity.** An engineer familiar with Irvine's building department knows the plan check reviewers' preferences, understands the city's standard conditions of approval, and knows when third-party review is the fastest path to permit. This institutional knowledge saves time and money.

**Fast Turnaround Capability.** Commercial TI projects are time-critical — every day of permit delay is a day of lost lease revenue for the tenant and missed rent for the landlord. AAA Engineering prioritizes TI permit packages and provides 4 to 6 week delivery from engagement to permit submittal for standard projects.

**Coordination with TI Architect and Contractor.** Structural engineering for TI projects works best when the structural engineer is integrated into the design team early. AAA Engineering participates in design team coordination meetings, reviews architectural plans as they evolve, and flags structural issues before they become costly change orders.

**Responsive Construction Support.** During TI construction, structural issues arise constantly — field conditions that do not match drawings, contractor questions about installation sequence, material substitutions. An engineer who responds to RFIs within 24 hours keeps construction moving. AAA Engineering provides priority RFI response for all active TI construction projects.

## What Are Common TI Structural Challenges in Irvine?

Irvine commercial TI projects encounter predictable structural challenges that experienced engineers address proactively.

**Undocumented Previous Modifications.** Many Irvine commercial buildings have been through multiple tenant cycles with successive modifications. Previous tenants removed load-bearing walls without permits, added mezzanines with inadequate structural support, or cut HVAC openings without header reinforcement. AAA Engineering's initial structural assessment identifies existing non-compliant conditions and designs comprehensive remediation as part of the new TI.

**Tilt-Up Panel Penetration Restrictions.** Tenants in tilt-up buildings frequently request new storefront windows, dock doors, or mechanical penetrations in the tilt-up wall panels. Every tilt-up panel is a critical shear wall element — penetrations disrupt both gravity and lateral load paths. AAA Engineering analyzes tilt-up panel capacity with and without proposed penetrations and designs reinforced openings using steel lintels, jamb reinforcing, and supplemental shear transfer elements when penetrations are structurally feasible.

**Mezzanine Column Interference with Operations.** Tenants adding mezzanines want minimal columns on the floor level below — interior columns interfere with manufacturing operations, vehicle traffic, and storage layouts. AAA Engineering designs long-span mezzanine structural systems using steel wide-flange beams, castellated beams, or trusses to minimize column count. We optimize column spacing to meet tenant layout requirements while keeping steel tonnage — and cost — within budget.

**Insufficient Existing Floor Capacity for Heavy Equipment.** Industrial tenants installing heavy manufacturing equipment frequently exceed the building's design floor live load. A typical Irvine industrial building is designed for 125 psf uniform floor live load — heavy manufacturing equipment imposes point loads of 50,000 to 200,000 lbs. AAA Engineering designs supplemental grade beams, pile caps, or reinforced slab sections to transfer concentrated equipment loads to the ground without overstressing the existing floor system.

**Seismic Upgrade Triggers.** CBC 2022 Section 3403 triggers seismic upgrade requirements when a TI project's valuation exceeds defined thresholds. A substantial TI in an older Irvine building triggers the requirement to bring the entire building's lateral system up to current code — a cost of $200,000 to $1,000,000 that dwarfs the TI cost. AAA Engineering analyzes upgrade trigger thresholds at project initiation and helps clients structure their projects to stay below triggers where practicable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does every commercial TI in Irvine require a structural engineer?**
A: Any commercial TI that involves structural modifications — removing or modifying load-bearing walls, creating new openings in structural framing, adding mezzanines, installing rooftop equipment requiring structural penetrations, or adding heavy equipment that exceeds floor design loads — requires stamped structural drawings from a California PE. Non-structural TI work (paint, carpet, non-load-bearing partitions, electrical, plumbing) typically does not require structural engineering. The TI architect and City of Irvine building inspector determine which elements of a specific project require structural engineering.

**Q: How long does structural engineering take for a typical Irvine commercial TI?**
A: For standard commercial TI projects, AAA Engineering delivers permit-ready structural drawings within 4 to 6 weeks of engagement and receiving existing building drawings. City of Irvine plan check adds 4 to 8 weeks. Total time from engineering engagement to permit issuance is typically 10 to 16 weeks. Projects with existing complete structural documentation and simple modifications move faster.

**Q: What is a mezzanine and when does it require structural engineering?**
A: A mezzanine is an intermediate floor level within a commercial space, typically between the ground floor slab and the roof. Mezzanines increase usable square footage without extending the building footprint. Every mezzanine addition in Irvine requires structural engineering — the mezzanine structure must be designed for CBC 2022 live loads (50 psf for office, 100 psf for storage), seismic forces, and guardrail lateral loads. The mezzanine columns and beams must also be verified to be compatible with the existing foundation and floor system capacity.

**Q: What does an open floor plan conversion require structurally?**
A: Converting subdivided office space to an open floor plan requires identifying which interior walls are load-bearing, designing transfer beams and columns to replace the load path for structural walls that are removed, and verifying that the modified lateral system still meets code requirements. AAA Engineering examines original building drawings, conducts field verification, and designs the complete structural modification package for open plan conversions of any size.

**Q: Can I add a mezzanine to a concrete tilt-up building in Irvine?**
A: Yes, mezzanines are frequently added to concrete tilt-up industrial buildings in Irvine. The key structural considerations are: (1) mezzanine column loads must be transferred to the slab-on-grade without overloading the slab or underlying soils; (2) mezzanine structural framing must be connected to the tilt-up panels in a way that is compatible with the panel's structural design; (3) the mezzanine's seismic mass increases the building's total seismic demand and must be analyzed within the building's lateral system. AAA Engineering designs tilt-up mezzanine systems that meet all of these requirements.

**Q: What is an ADA compliance structural modification?**
A: ADA compliance modifications that require structural engineering include: reinforcing restroom walls for grab bar installation (requires blocking or structural wood framing to resist grab bar loads of 250 lbs or more); structural support for ADA-compliant ramps; lowering service counters that require cutting or modifying structural slabs; and installation of platform lifts that require structural anchorage. AAA Engineering designs structural support for all ADA modifications as part of commercial TI projects.

**Q: Does adding a mezzanine trigger a seismic upgrade in an older Irvine building?**
A: In some cases, yes. CBC 2022 Section 3403 requires seismic upgrades when a project's valuation exceeds 50 percent of the building's replacement value, or when the project substantially increases the building's seismic weight (mass) or changes the building's lateral force distribution. Mezzanine additions that add significant mass to an older building trigger upgrade requirements. AAA Engineering analyzes upgrade trigger thresholds before project design and advises clients on the implications for their specific building and project scope.

**Q: How do HVAC penetrations through tilt-up roof structures get engineered?**
A: HVAC penetrations through tilt-up building roof structures — typically steel bar joists, metal deck, and roofing — require engineering analysis of each opening's effect on the affected roof members. AAA Engineering designs header and trimmer systems using additional steel framing or modified joist configurations to redistribute loads around each penetration. We also design the structural support for rooftop HVAC units — equipment pads, curbing, and seismic anchorage — as part of each penetration design.
