Calabasas homeowners are adding ADUs at a remarkable pace. The Calabasas planning commission approved 78 ADU permits in 2024 — triple the volume from 2020 — driven by California's aggressive ADU reform legislation and Calabasas's own streamlined permitting procedures. With Calabasas single-family lots typically measuring 10,000 to 40,000 square feet, there is substantial space for detached ADUs, and with median home values exceeding $1.2 million, the rental income from an ADU returns 6 to 10 percent annually on the construction investment.

But Calabasas ADUs are not simple projects. The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District has specific connection requirements. The Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ) that covers most of Calabasas imposes specific construction requirements including non-combustible roofing, ember-resistant vents, and specific exterior finish materials. Hillside lots require engineered foundations that address slope stability. Every ADU needs structural engineering drawings to obtain a building permit from the City of Calabasas.

AAA Engineering Design is the structural engineering partner that Calabasas homeowners and ADU developers trust to navigate these complexities and deliver permit-ready ADU structural packages efficiently.

## What Is ADU Structural Engineering?

ADU structural engineering encompasses the design and professional certification of all structural systems required for an accessory dwelling unit — whether a detached new-build structure, a garage conversion, an attached addition, or a junior ADU (JADU) created within the existing dwelling's footprint.

California law defines four ADU types: (1) detached ADUs, (2) attached ADUs, (3) ADUs within existing structures (conversions), and (4) junior ADUs. Each type presents different structural engineering requirements. Detached ADUs require complete new structural design — foundation, floor system, wall framing, roof system, and lateral force-resisting system. Garage conversions require evaluation of the existing garage structure's adequacy for habitable use, design of any required strengthening, and design of new foundation elements for added living area. JADUs involve structural modifications within the existing main dwelling.

California's ADU reform legislation — including AB 68, AB 881, SB 13, and AB 3182 — has dramatically simplified ADU approval in cities including Calabasas. But simplification of the planning approval process does not eliminate the structural engineering requirement. Every ADU in Calabasas requires stamped structural drawings from a California-licensed PE as a condition of building permit issuance.

AAA Engineering's ADU structural engineering services are available through our [ADU engineering services](/services/adu-engineering) program, which covers the complete range of ADU types across Southern California. Our [residential structural engineering](/services/residential) services provide the broader residential context for ADU projects on established properties.

## What ADU Structural Engineering Services Are Available in Calabasas?

Calabasas ADU projects have access to a comprehensive range of structural engineering services matched to the most common ADU types in the Calabasas market.

**Detached ADU Design.** Detached ADUs are freestanding structures built on the same lot as the primary dwelling. In Calabasas, detached ADUs up to 1,200 SF are permitted by right under California law. AAA Engineering designs complete structural systems for detached ADUs from foundation to roof — shallow or deep foundations depending on soil and slope conditions, wood-frame floor and wall systems, roof framing, shear wall lateral systems, and all connection details. Our designs comply with the CBC 2022 and the City of Calabasas's specific ADU standards.

**Garage Conversion ADU Engineering.** Converting an attached or detached garage to habitable space is the fastest and most affordable ADU path for Calabasas homeowners with existing garages. Structural engineering for garage conversions includes evaluation of the existing slab for habitability (thickness, drainage, moisture barrier), design of any required slab modifications, assessment of existing wall framing for habitable use adequacy, design of new window and door openings in existing walls, assessment of roof structure for any increased loads from insulation and drywall, and design of any required shear wall upgrades for the converted space.

**JADU Structural Engineering.** Junior ADUs are created within the walls of the existing main dwelling, typically by converting a bedroom and bathroom or a finished basement. JADUs are limited to 500 SF and require a separate entrance. Structural engineering for JADUs involves creating the required separate entrance (new exterior door opening in an existing wall — requires structural header design), any internal wall reconfiguration needed to create a self-contained unit, and verification that existing structural systems meet habitable space requirements.

**Hillside ADU Engineering.** A defining characteristic of Calabasas is its topography — many of the most desirable properties sit on slopes in the Santa Monica Mountains foothills. Hillside ADUs present specific structural challenges: stepped foundations on sloping sites, retaining walls required to create level building pads, drainage design to protect foundations from hillside runoff, and slope stability analysis to confirm that the ADU's foundation loads do not destabilize the slope. AAA Engineering's [hillside engineering services](/services/hillside-engineering) address all of these challenges with designs that reflect the specific topographic and soil conditions at each site.

**California AB 68 and SB 13 Compliance Engineering.** California's ADU reform legislation imposes specific requirements that affect structural design: ADUs must comply with CBC 2022, setback requirements are relaxed but structure-to-structure separation distances still apply, and fire hazard zone requirements impose specific material and construction requirements. AAA Engineering's ADU packages include all required code compliance documentation for Calabasas plan check.

**Fire Hazard Zone ADU Requirements.** Calabasas falls within the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone designated by CalFire. VHFHSZ designation requires specific construction standards for new ADUs: Class A fire-rated roofing, ember-resistant vents (tested to ASTM E2886), no-gap eave soffit details, non-combustible exterior finish materials at critical locations, and 5-foot setback from structures for combustible landscaping. AAA Engineering incorporates these fire-resistant construction requirements into ADU structural packages, and our drawings specify the required materials and details explicitly to satisfy Calabasas plan check.

## How Does the ADU Structural Engineering Process Work in California?

California's ADU permitting process has been streamlined by state law, but the structural engineering process follows a consistent sequence regardless of which California jurisdiction a project is in.

**Step 1: Site Assessment and ADU Feasibility (Week 1).** AAA Engineering visits the Calabasas property to assess the site's ADU development potential from a structural and geotechnical perspective. We review lot dimensions, topography, soil type (visible from site observation and available geotechnical mapping), existing structures to be converted or adjacent to the new ADU, utility easements, and setback conditions. The site assessment identifies potential structural challenges and informs the ADU type and location decision.

**Step 2: Geotechnical Investigation (Weeks 1-3).** For detached ADUs on hillside lots, a geotechnical investigation is required to characterize soil conditions, determine allowable bearing pressure, assess slope stability, and identify liquefaction potential. AAA Engineering coordinates geotechnical investigation scheduling and reviews soils reports for structural design input. Flat lots in Calabasas do not require full geotechnical investigation in all cases, depending on soil uniformity and ADU foundation type.

**Step 3: Structural Design (Weeks 2-5).** AAA Engineering develops the complete ADU structural design: foundation plan, floor framing plan, wall framing plan, roof framing plan, shear wall schedule, and all connection details. For garage conversions, we evaluate existing structure adequacy and design all required upgrades. For hillside ADUs, we design the stepped or pier foundation system and any required retaining walls.

**Step 4: Permit Package Preparation (Weeks 4-7).** Our CAD team produces City of Calabasas-ready structural drawings coordinated with the ADU architect's drawings. We include all required fire hazard zone construction notes and details, CBC 2022 compliance documentation, and the energy compliance documentation (Title 24) for structural elements.

**Step 5: City of Calabasas Plan Check (Weeks 7-13).** Calabasas Building and Safety reviews ADU permit applications. ADUs meeting the City's pre-approved ADU standards use streamlined review (3 to 4 weeks). Custom ADUs with non-standard features or hillside locations use standard review (5 to 8 weeks). AAA Engineering responds to plan check corrections promptly.

**Step 6: Construction Support.** AAA Engineering provides construction support through project completion — RFI response within 24 hours, structural observation at required milestones, and final inspection support.

## What Are the Regional Considerations for Calabasas?

Calabasas ADU structural engineering operates within a regional context that differs from LA's coastal and flatland markets.

**Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.** CalFire designates virtually all of Calabasas as VHFHSZ — the highest fire risk designation in California. The 2018 Woolsey Fire destroyed or damaged hundreds of properties in adjacent Malibu and unincorporated areas immediately north of Calabasas. VHFHSZ designation requires specific construction standards for new ADUs that AAA Engineering incorporates into every Calabasas ADU structural package. These requirements add cost but are non-negotiable for permit issuance.

**Las Virgenes Municipal Water District.** ADUs in Calabasas must obtain water and sewer service connections from LVMWD. LVMWD's ADU connection process involves capacity verification and connection fee payments that affect project economics. AAA Engineering coordinates with LVMWD connection requirements when sizing utility connections at foundation stage.

**Santa Monica Mountains Topography and Soils.** Calabasas sits in the transition zone between the Los Angeles Basin and the Santa Monica Mountains. Soils vary from expansive Topanga Formation claystones on hillside properties to alluvial deposits in the Calabasas Creek corridor. Hillside properties frequently have fill soils from historical grading that require verification of compaction adequacy before supporting ADU foundations. AAA Engineering's hillside ADU designs address both native soil variability and fill soil conditions.

**Seismic Exposure.** The Calabasas area experienced strong shaking in the 1994 Northridge earthquake — the Santa Susana Pass area recorded some of the highest ground accelerations in the event. Calabasas sits within CBC 2022 Seismic Design Category D, requiring full seismic design for all new ADUs. AAA Engineering's ADU lateral systems use properly designed shear walls and diaphragms complying with CBC 2022 seismic requirements.

**Comparison to Neighboring Communities.** Woodland Hills ADUs face similar fire hazard and topography challenges to Calabasas but are under LA City Building and Safety jurisdiction, which has different plan check procedures. Hidden Hills, an incorporated city within the same geographic area as Calabasas, has its own planning department with additional aesthetic review requirements for ADUs. Agoura Hills ADUs follow LA County Building and Safety procedures. Malibu ADUs face the most stringent coastal and fire hazard requirements of any community in the region. Westlake Village, split between LA and Ventura Counties, uses County of LA or Ventura County procedures depending on the property's location. AAA Engineering is familiar with all of these jurisdictions.

## How Much Does ADU Structural Engineering Cost in Calabasas?

ADU structural engineering fees in Calabasas range from $2,500 to $8,000, depending on ADU type, site complexity, and hillside conditions.

**Fee Schedule by ADU Type:**

*JADU or Simple Garage Conversion (500 SF or less, flat site, existing adequate structure):*
- Structural evaluation and drawings: $2,500-$3,500
- Plan check support: included
- Construction RFI support: $500
- **Total typical fee: $3,000-$4,000**

*Standard Detached ADU (600-1,000 SF, flat or gentle slope, straightforward soils):*
- Structural design and drawings: $3,500-$5,500
- Plan check support: included
- Construction observation (2 visits): $800-$1,200
- **Total typical fee: $4,300-$6,700**

*Hillside ADU (Any size, slope greater than 5%, stepped foundation, retaining elements):*
- Structural design and drawings: $5,000-$8,000
- Retaining wall design (if required): $1,500-$3,000
- Geotechnical coordination: included (client provides soils report)
- Construction observation (3 visits): $1,200-$2,000
- **Total typical fee: $7,700-$13,000**

**Context for Calabasas ADU Economics.** A 1,000 SF detached ADU in Calabasas rents for $3,000 to $4,500 per month in the current market — $36,000 to $54,000 annually. Structural engineering fees of $4,000 to $8,000 represent 1 to 2 months of rental income. The structural engineering investment is recovered within the first month of occupancy.

Our [ADU engineering services](/services/adu-engineering) and [foundation engineering services](/services/foundation-engineering) cover the full range of Calabasas ADU project needs.

## How Do You Select the Right ADU Structural Engineer in Calabasas?

Selecting the right structural engineer for your Calabasas ADU determines whether the project gets permitted efficiently or gets stuck in plan check for months.

**City of Calabasas Permit Experience.** Calabasas has its own building department with specific ADU review procedures. Engineers familiar with the Calabasas plan check process produce drawings in the format reviewers expect, include all required fire hazard zone documentation, and respond to corrections in the reviewers' preferred format. AAA Engineering has prepared and successfully permitted dozens of ADU packages through Calabasas Building and Safety.

**VHFHSZ Construction Expertise.** Fire hazard zone construction requirements are a specialty. Confirm that the engineer's drawings explicitly specify Class A roofing materials, ember-resistant vent products by manufacturer and model number, non-combustible exterior finish details, and all other VHFHSZ-required elements. Vague references to "fire-rated materials" are insufficient — Calabasas plan check requires specific product identification.

**Hillside ADU Track Record.** For hillside properties, verify that the engineer has designed stepped foundations, grade beam and pier systems, and retaining walls for hillside ADU projects. Ask for examples of similar hillside ADU projects with successful permits.

**All-Inclusive Fee Quotes.** Confirm that the fee quote includes all anticipated services: design, drawings, geotechnical coordination, plan check support, and standard construction support. AAA Engineering provides fixed-fee quotes for defined scopes with transparent identification of services that generate additional charges if project scope changes.

## What Are Common ADU Structural Challenges in Calabasas?

Calabasas ADU projects encounter predictable structural challenges rooted in the community's fire hazard status, topography, and soil conditions.

**Fire Zone Structural-Architectural Coordination.** VHFHSZ requirements affect structural design decisions in ways that are not always obvious. Ember-resistant vent placement must be coordinated with roof framing — vents cannot be located adjacent to rafter bearing points where structural continuity is critical. Non-combustible exterior cladding imposes additional dead load on the wall framing that must be accounted for in wall stud sizing. AAA Engineering reviews architectural documents specifically for fire-structural coordination issues before completing structural design.

**Hillside Fill Soil Variability.** Many Calabasas properties were graded in the 1970s and 1980s using cut-and-fill techniques with limited compaction documentation. Fill soils with inadequate compaction cannot support new ADU foundations without supplemental densification or deep foundation systems. AAA Engineering designs conservative foundations that either verify fill adequacy through geotechnical testing or bypass fill soils using drilled piers bearing on native materials.

**Water and Drainage Management.** Calabasas properties in the Santa Monica Mountains foothills experience significant stormwater runoff from upslope areas during heavy rainfall. Inadequate drainage management around ADU foundations causes erosion, foundation undermining, and slope destabilization. AAA Engineering designs ADU foundations with drainage systems — French drains, surface swales, and area drains — that protect foundations from water intrusion and saturation.

**Wildfire Defensible Space Impact on ADU Siting.** California's defensible space requirements for VHFHSZ affect where ADUs can be sited on Calabasas lots. ADUs within the defensible space zones require non-combustible construction throughout and cannot use wood decks or combustible landscaping within defined clearances. AAA Engineering coordinates with the property owner's fire clearance plan to site ADUs within compliant locations.

## Local Social Proof

**Patricia and James N. — Calabasas (Park Oaks)**
"We built a 1,000 SF detached ADU in our Calabasas backyard for my mother-in-law. The property is on a gentle slope and we needed a stepped foundation. AAA Engineering designed the foundation, did all the structural work for the ADU framing, and made sure the fire zone requirements were covered. The City approved our permit in 7 weeks — the planning department told us our structural package was one of the most complete they had seen. The ADU is beautifully built and structurally perfect."

**David K. — Calabasas (Mulholland Corridor)**
"Our garage was a two-car detached structure that we converted to a rental ADU. AAA Engineering evaluated the existing slab and framing, designed the structural modifications for the new windows and doors, and provided all the shear wall upgrades the City required. The whole structural package took 5 weeks to deliver. The conversion came out exactly as planned and the tenant has been there 18 months — no issues."

**Rachel H. — Woodland Hills**
"I live in Woodland Hills but heard about AAA Engineering through my Calabasas neighbor. They designed a detached ADU for my hillside lot that required a stepped foundation and a small retaining wall on the downslope side. The engineering was thorough, the drawings were detailed, and LA City Building and Safety approved the structural package with one minor correction. AAA was responsive throughout the whole project. Would use them again."

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does every ADU in Calabasas require structural engineering?**
A: Yes. The City of Calabasas requires stamped structural drawings from a California-licensed PE for every ADU permit application — detached ADUs, attached ADUs, garage conversions, and JADUs. State law simplifications under AB 68 and SB 13 apply to planning approval, not to building permit requirements. The building permit process requires complete structural engineering documentation regardless of the planning approval pathway.

**Q: What is the maximum ADU size allowed in Calabasas?**
A: Under California state law as of 2024, detached ADUs up to 1,200 SF are permitted by right in Calabasas. Attached ADUs are limited to 50 percent of the primary dwelling's floor area or 1,200 SF, whichever is less. JADUs are limited to 500 SF. Calabasas's local ADU ordinance cannot impose size limits below the state minimums. AAA Engineering designs ADUs to maximize the allowable size for clients seeking maximum rental income potential.

**Q: How does the fire hazard zone affect ADU construction costs in Calabasas?**
A: VHFHSZ construction requirements add approximately $15,000 to $35,000 to ADU construction costs compared to non-VHFHSZ areas. The premium covers Class A roofing materials (vs. standard asphalt shingles), ember-resistant vents, fire-resistant exterior siding and trim materials, and any required non-combustible underlayment. These costs are unavoidable for Calabasas ADU construction — they are required by both state law and the City of Calabasas building code.

**Q: Can I build an ADU on a hillside lot in Calabasas?**
A: Yes. Hillside lots in Calabasas are fully eligible for ADU construction under California state law, and the City of Calabasas's ADU ordinance does not impose slope restrictions beyond standard setback and grading requirements. Hillside ADUs require geotechnical investigation, engineered foundations (typically grade beams and drilled piers rather than simple spread footings), and drainage design. AAA Engineering designs hillside ADU foundations for all Calabasas slope conditions.

**Q: What is a JADU and how does it differ from a standard ADU?**
A: A Junior ADU (JADU) is an ADU created entirely within the walls of the existing primary dwelling, limited to 500 SF. JADUs require a separate exterior entry (private door to the outside) but share a bathroom with the primary unit. JADUs are subject to an owner-occupancy requirement — the property owner must live in either the primary dwelling or the JADU. Standard ADUs (detached or attached) have no owner-occupancy requirement as of 2020 (SB 13). For structural engineering, JADUs typically require less work than detached ADUs — primarily a new exterior door opening in an existing wall plus any interior reconfiguration — and cost less to engineer.

**Q: Does the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District affect ADU construction in Calabasas?**
A: Yes. LVMWD provides water and sewer service to Calabasas and requires ADU connection applications before permits are issued. LVMWD verifies available water and sewer capacity for the new unit and assesses connection fees based on the ADU's fixture count. LVMWD connection fees for ADUs are regulated under California AB 2299 and are limited to proportionate charges — typically $2,000 to $8,000 depending on the ADU size and distance to existing mains. AAA Engineering coordinates with LVMWD connection requirements to ensure ADU utility designs satisfy the district's standards.

**Q: How long does it take to get an ADU permit in Calabasas?**
A: With a complete structural package from AAA Engineering, Calabasas ADU permits are typically issued in 8 to 14 weeks from permit application submittal. Streamlined ADU review (for ADUs meeting pre-approved standards) takes 6 to 8 weeks. Standard review for custom or hillside ADUs takes 8 to 14 weeks. Total time from AAA Engineering engagement to permit issuance is typically 14 to 22 weeks.
