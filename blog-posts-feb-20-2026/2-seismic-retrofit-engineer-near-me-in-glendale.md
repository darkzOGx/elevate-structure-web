## What Is Seismic Retrofit Engineering?

Seismic retrofit engineering is the specialized structural engineering discipline focused on evaluating existing buildings for earthquake vulnerability and designing structural modifications that bring them into compliance with current life-safety standards. Unlike new construction design — where engineers specify systems from scratch — seismic retrofit engineering requires detailed assessment of existing structural conditions, identification of specific deficiencies, and targeted interventions that strengthen the building without complete reconstruction.

A seismic retrofit engineer near me in Glendale performs three core functions:

**Seismic Vulnerability Assessment.** The engineer evaluates the existing building's lateral force resisting system (LFRS) against current code requirements. This includes analyzing shear walls, moment frames, bracing systems, foundations, diaphragms, and connections to determine where the building falls short of current seismic standards. For Glendale buildings, this assessment considers the city's high seismic hazard parameters — Ss values of 1.8-2.4g and S1 values of 0.6-0.8g — which generate large design base shear forces.

**Retrofit Design.** Based on the vulnerability assessment, the engineer designs structural modifications that address identified deficiencies. Retrofit strategies include adding new shear walls, installing steel moment frames, strengthening existing walls with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps, adding foundation elements, and upgrading connections between structural components. The design must comply with ASCE 41-17 (Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings) and the 2022 California Existing Building Code (CEBC).

**Construction Documents and Permitting.** The engineer produces PE-stamped construction drawings and structural calculations that the Glendale Building and Safety Division requires for permit issuance. These documents guide contractors through the retrofit construction process and provide the basis for building department inspections.

## Why Glendale Needs Seismic Retrofit Engineering

### Proximity to Active Fault Lines

Glendale occupies one of the most seismically hazardous locations in the greater Los Angeles basin. The city sits within 3 miles of the Verdugo Fault, a significant thrust fault that runs along the base of the Verdugo Mountains forming Glendale's northeastern boundary. The Raymond Fault passes within 5 miles to the south, and the Hollywood Fault lies approximately 6 miles to the southwest.

The USGS National Seismic Hazard Model assigns Glendale short-period spectral acceleration (Ss) values of 1.8-2.4g depending on site class — among the highest in Los Angeles County. These mapped ground motion values translate directly into the seismic design forces that Glendale buildings must resist. A magnitude 6.5+ earthquake on the Verdugo Fault would produce intense ground shaking throughout Glendale, with peak ground accelerations potentially exceeding 0.6g in areas with soft soil amplification.

### Glendale's Mandatory Soft-Story Retrofit Ordinance

The City of Glendale adopted a mandatory soft-story seismic retrofit ordinance targeting wood-frame buildings with soft, weak, or open-front conditions at the ground floor level. These buildings — typically apartment buildings with tuck-under parking or ground-floor commercial space — are among the most vulnerable building types in seismic events, as demonstrated by widespread collapses during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

Glendale's ordinance applies to:

- Wood-frame buildings with 3 or more stories
- Buildings with ground-floor parking (tuck-under configuration)
- Structures built under pre-1978 building codes
- Multi-family residential occupancies

Property owners of identified buildings must retain a licensed engineer, submit retrofit plans to Glendale Building and Safety, and complete construction within the ordinance's compliance timeline. Failure to comply results in escalating penalties and potential building vacancy orders.

### Aging Building Stock

Glendale's building inventory includes substantial numbers of structures built between 1920 and 1975 — an era that predates the seismic design provisions triggered by the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and refined after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. These older Glendale buildings commonly exhibit:

- Soft-story conditions in apartment buildings along Brand Boulevard, Central Avenue, and Glenoaks Boulevard
- Unreinforced masonry (URM) construction in older commercial buildings downtown
- Non-ductile concrete frame buildings susceptible to brittle column failure
- Inadequate foundation anchor bolts and cripple wall bracing in single-family homes
- Tilt-up industrial buildings with inadequate wall-to-roof connections in the Glendale industrial corridor

The City of Glendale's commitment to seismic safety through mandatory retrofit requirements reflects the reality that these vulnerable buildings pose unacceptable risks to life safety during the next significant earthquake.

### Economic and Liability Implications

Beyond life safety, seismic vulnerability creates significant economic exposure for Glendale property owners. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused $20 billion in damage across the Los Angeles basin, with apartment buildings suffering disproportionate losses. A major earthquake on the Verdugo Fault would concentrate damage in exactly the types of older buildings that populate Glendale's residential and commercial corridors.

Property owners who delay seismic retrofitting face:

- Escalating city penalties and compliance enforcement
- Increased insurance premiums or inability to obtain earthquake coverage
- Potential liability for tenant injuries during a seismic event
- Property devaluation as buyers increasingly demand seismic compliance documentation
- Post-earthquake repair costs that far exceed proactive retrofit investment

## Types of Seismic Retrofit Services in Glendale

### Soft-Story Retrofit

The most common seismic retrofit type in Glendale addresses soft-story conditions — buildings where the ground floor is significantly weaker or more flexible than the floors above. This condition typically occurs in apartment buildings with tuck-under parking where the ground floor has minimal shear walls due to parking openings.

Soft-story retrofit solutions for Glendale buildings include:

**Steel Moment Frames.** Welded or bolted steel frames installed within existing parking openings provide ductile lateral resistance without eliminating parking spaces. This is the most common Glendale soft-story retrofit approach, using HSS (hollow structural section) or wide-flange columns and beams designed per AISC 341 seismic provisions.

**Cantilever Column Systems.** Steel columns embedded in new drilled pier foundations and connected to the existing floor diaphragm above provide lateral resistance through cantilever action. This system works well in Glendale buildings with limited space for braced frames.

**Plywood Shear Walls.** Where parking openings allow, structural plywood sheathing applied to new or existing wood stud walls provides code-compliant lateral resistance at lower cost than steel frames.

Engineering fees for Glendale soft-story retrofit design: $8,000-$25,000. Construction costs: $60,000-$200,000 depending on building size and number of required frames.

### Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Retrofit

Glendale's downtown commercial district and older neighborhoods contain unreinforced masonry buildings — brick, stone, or hollow clay tile construction without steel reinforcement. These buildings are extremely vulnerable to seismic damage. URM retrofit approaches in Glendale include:

- Wall anchorage to floor and roof diaphragms (through-bolts or adhesive anchors)
- Parapet bracing to prevent falling hazards
- In-plane wall strengthening with shotcrete or FRP overlay
- New steel moment frames or braced frames to supplement existing masonry walls
- Diaphragm strengthening with plywood or steel deck overlay

### Residential Seismic Retrofit

Single-family homes and small residential buildings in Glendale benefit from targeted seismic retrofits that address the most common vulnerability patterns:

**Cripple Wall Bracing.** Homes with short stud walls between the foundation and first floor (cripple walls) are vulnerable to collapse. Structural plywood sheathing nailed to cripple wall studs per FEMA P-1100 provides effective bracing at modest cost ($3,000-$7,000 for construction).

**Foundation Bolting.** Pre-1971 Glendale homes frequently lack anchor bolts connecting the wood sill plate to the concrete foundation. Adding expansion bolts or adhesive anchors at 4-6 foot spacing prevents the house from sliding off its foundation during shaking. Our [foundation repair](/services/foundation-repair) services address these deficiencies.

**Soft-Story Residential.** Hillside homes in Glendale's Verdugo Mountains foothills and homes with attached garages at the front sometimes have soft-story conditions that require steel moment frames or plywood shear wall additions.

### Non-Ductile Concrete Retrofit

Concrete buildings in Glendale designed before 1976 may have non-ductile concrete columns — columns with widely spaced ties that fail in a brittle manner during earthquakes rather than deforming in a ductile, energy-absorbing manner. Retrofit strategies include:

- FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) column wrapping to increase confinement and ductility
- Steel jacketing of deficient columns
- Addition of new shear walls or braced frames to reduce column demands
- Joint strengthening at beam-column connections

## The Seismic Retrofit Process in Glendale

### Step 1: Seismic Evaluation (Weeks 1-3)

The process begins with a comprehensive seismic evaluation of your Glendale building. Our licensed PE inspects the existing structure, reviews available construction documents, and performs a preliminary analysis to identify seismic deficiencies. For soft-story buildings subject to Glendale's mandatory retrofit ordinance, this evaluation follows ASCE 41-17 Tier 1/Tier 2 procedures.

### Step 2: Retrofit Strategy Development (Weeks 3-5)

Based on the evaluation findings, we develop a retrofit strategy that addresses identified deficiencies while minimizing disruption to building occupants and parking. We present options to the Glendale property owner with comparative cost estimates and construction timelines for each approach.

### Step 3: Engineering Design (Weeks 5-10)

Our engineers produce PE-stamped construction documents including structural plans, details, specifications, and a calculations package. For Glendale soft-story retrofits, plans include steel frame designs, foundation details, connection specifications, and construction sequence requirements.

### Step 4: Permit Submittal and Plan Check (Weeks 10-18)

We submit plans to the Glendale Building and Safety Division at 633 East Broadway, Room 101. Plan check for seismic retrofit projects typically takes 6-8 weeks in Glendale. Our engineers respond to plan check comments promptly, and our familiarity with Glendale's review standards helps minimize correction cycles.

### Step 5: Construction Phase (Weeks 18-30+)

During construction, our engineers provide construction observation visits, respond to contractor RFIs (Requests for Information), and coordinate with Glendale building inspectors. For soft-story retrofits, critical inspections include foundation pier installation, steel frame erection, welding inspection (if applicable), and final connection verification.

### Step 6: Compliance Certification

Upon construction completion and final inspection approval from Glendale Building and Safety, we provide a completion letter documenting that the seismic retrofit has been constructed in substantial conformance with the approved plans. This documentation satisfies Glendale's mandatory retrofit ordinance compliance requirements.

## Glendale Building Code Requirements for Seismic Retrofits

### 2022 California Building Code and CEBC

Seismic retrofit projects in Glendale must comply with the 2022 California Existing Building Code (CEBC) and reference standards including ASCE 41-17 for seismic evaluation and retrofit design. Key Glendale seismic design parameters include:

- **Seismic Design Category**: D or E depending on building importance and site class
- **Mapped Spectral Accelerations**: Ss = 1.8-2.4g, S1 = 0.6-0.8g
- **Site Class**: Varies from B (rock in Verdugo foothills) to D (stiff soil in valley areas)
- **Performance Objective**: Life Safety for mandatory retrofit ordinance compliance; higher performance levels available for voluntary upgrades

### Glendale Mandatory Retrofit Ordinance

The City of Glendale's mandatory seismic retrofit ordinance establishes:

- **Screening Criteria**: Wood-frame buildings with 3+ stories, ground-floor parking openings, pre-1978 construction
- **Compliance Timeline**: Phased deadlines with engineering submittal and construction completion milestones
- **Penalties**: Daily fines, building placarding, and potential vacancy orders for non-compliance
- **Permit Requirements**: Full structural engineering plans with PE stamp, geotechnical report (if foundations are modified), and special inspection requirements for steel welding

### ASCE 41-17 Evaluation Procedures

The American Society of Civil Engineers standard ASCE 41-17 provides the technical framework for seismic evaluation and retrofit design in Glendale. The three-tier evaluation process includes:

- **Tier 1 Screening**: Checklist-based evaluation identifying potential deficiencies
- **Tier 2 Deficiency-Based Evaluation**: Detailed analysis of deficiencies identified in Tier 1
- **Tier 3 Systematic Evaluation**: Complete building analysis using nonlinear static (pushover) or dynamic analysis procedures

Most Glendale soft-story retrofits proceed through Tier 2 evaluation, which provides sufficient analytical basis for retrofit design without the complexity and cost of Tier 3 nonlinear analysis.

## How to Choose the Right Seismic Retrofit Engineer in Glendale

### Specialized Seismic Experience

Seismic retrofit engineering requires different expertise than new construction design. Look for an engineer with a track record of completed retrofit projects — not just general structural engineering experience. Ask about specific Glendale soft-story, URM, or concrete retrofit projects the engineer has designed and permitted.

### Familiarity with Glendale Building and Safety

The Glendale Building and Safety Division has specific submittal requirements, plan check standards, and inspection procedures for seismic retrofit projects. An engineer who has successfully permitted retrofit projects through Glendale's review process understands what the plan checkers expect and can avoid costly correction cycles.

### Construction-Practical Design

The best seismic retrofit designs balance structural performance with constructability. An experienced seismic retrofit engineer near me in Glendale designs systems that contractors can build efficiently within occupied buildings, minimizing tenant displacement and construction duration. Steel moment frames should be sized for practical fabrication, foundation details should account for existing utility conflicts, and connection details should be workable in tight spaces.

### Clear Communication and Project Management

Seismic retrofit projects involve coordination between property owners, engineers, contractors, special inspectors, and the Glendale Building Division. Choose an engineer who communicates project status clearly, manages the permit process proactively, and responds to construction-phase questions promptly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is seismic retrofitting mandatory in Glendale?

Yes, for certain building types. Glendale's mandatory seismic retrofit ordinance requires owners of wood-frame multi-family buildings with soft-story conditions (typically tuck-under parking) built before 1978 to complete structural retrofits within specified compliance deadlines. Non-compliance results in escalating fines and potential building vacancy orders. Contact (949) 981-4448 to determine whether your Glendale building is subject to the ordinance.

### How much does a soft-story retrofit cost in Glendale?

Soft-story retrofit costs in Glendale depend on building size, number of stories, and existing structural conditions. For a typical 4-8 unit apartment building, engineering design costs $8,000-$15,000 and construction costs $60,000-$120,000. Larger buildings (9-20 units) typically require $15,000-$25,000 in engineering and $120,000-$200,000 in construction. These costs reflect 2026 Glendale market conditions.

### How long does a seismic retrofit take from start to finish in Glendale?

The complete process from initial evaluation through construction completion typically takes 6-12 months for soft-story retrofits in Glendale. Engineering design takes 4-8 weeks, plan check at Glendale Building and Safety takes 6-8 weeks, and construction takes 8-16 weeks depending on building size and complexity. Residential cripple wall and bolting retrofits are substantially faster — typically 4-8 weeks total.

### Can tenants stay during a soft-story retrofit in Glendale?

In most cases, yes. Soft-story retrofit construction in Glendale primarily affects the ground-floor parking area and does not require tenant relocation from upper-floor units. Tenants may experience temporary parking displacement during construction, but living spaces remain accessible and occupied. Our retrofit designs minimize tenant disruption by concentrating work in parking areas and limiting construction to standard business hours.

### What faults are near Glendale?

Glendale sits within 3 miles of the Verdugo Fault, a thrust fault running along the Verdugo Mountains. The Raymond Fault passes approximately 5 miles south of central Glendale, and the Hollywood Fault lies roughly 6 miles to the southwest. The Sierra Madre Fault system runs north of the Verdugo Mountains. Any of these faults is capable of producing significant earthquakes affecting Glendale, which is why the USGS classifies the area as one of the highest seismic hazard zones in Los Angeles County.

### Does seismic retrofitting increase property value in Glendale?

Yes. Seismic retrofit compliance documentation is increasingly demanded by buyers, lenders, and insurers in Glendale. A retrofitted building commands premium valuations compared to non-compliant properties, and the retrofit investment is typically recovered through increased property value, reduced insurance premiums, and elimination of mandatory compliance penalties. Banks and institutional investors routinely require seismic compliance verification before financing Glendale apartment acquisitions.

### What is the difference between a seismic evaluation and a seismic retrofit?

A seismic evaluation is an assessment of an existing building's earthquake resistance — it identifies vulnerabilities but does not fix them. A seismic retrofit is the physical construction work that strengthens the building to address those vulnerabilities. The evaluation comes first and informs the retrofit design. In Glendale, a seismic evaluation report costs $2,000-$6,000, while a complete retrofit project (design plus construction) ranges from $70,000-$225,000 for soft-story apartment buildings.
