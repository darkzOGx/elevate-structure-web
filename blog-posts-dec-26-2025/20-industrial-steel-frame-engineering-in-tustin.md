Industrial steel frame engineering in Tustin delivers expert structural design for warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and industrial buildings throughout this Orange County community. Our licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of experience provide comprehensive steel building design for Tustin's industrial properties, including the Tustin Legacy development on the former Marine Corps Air Station.

Tustin's redevelopment of former military land and ongoing industrial growth creates opportunities for new steel frame industrial construction. Our California PE-licensed engineers design efficient steel structures meeting California seismic requirements while optimizing material use and construction efficiency.

## What Is Industrial Steel Frame Engineering?

**Direct Answer:**
Industrial steel frame engineering encompasses professional design of structural steel building systems for industrial applications. In Tustin, licensed Professional Engineers design steel moment frames, braced frames, and other lateral systems, along with gravity framing, crane systems, and specialized industrial loading requirements while meeting California's stringent seismic codes.

Steel frames offer advantages for industrial buildings including long spans, high clear heights, and construction efficiency that support warehouse and manufacturing operations.

## What Steel Frame Services Are Available?

**Direct Answer:**
Tustin industrial steel frame services include new construction design, building expansion engineering, crane system design, mezzanine additions, seismic retrofit of steel buildings, and connection design.

**New Steel Building Design**
