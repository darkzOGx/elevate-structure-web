**Direct Answer:** Common challenges include existing foundation capacity limitations, structural integration with existing framing, maintaining load paths through additions, and addressing expansive soil conditions common in the Inland Empire.

**Challenge 1: Existing Foundation Capacity**

**Problem:** Existing foundations may not have capacity for second story or may not extend to addition footprint.

**Solution:** Engineering evaluation of existing foundation with recommendations for underpinning, new foundation construction, or connection details appropriate to existing conditions.
