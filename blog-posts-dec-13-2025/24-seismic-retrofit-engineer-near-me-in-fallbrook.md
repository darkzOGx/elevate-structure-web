## What Are Common Seismic Deficiencies in Fallbrook Homes?

**Direct Answer:** Common deficiencies include unbolted foundations, unbraced cripple walls, unreinforced chimneys, and weak garage wall lines. Many Fallbrook homes built before 1980 have multiple vulnerabilities that can be addressed through retrofitting.

**Deficiency 1: Unbolted Foundations**

**Problem:** Older homes often sit on foundations without anchor bolts, allowing sliding during earthquake shaking.

**Solution:** Installation of foundation bolts connecting mud sill to concrete foundation, typically every 4-6 feet per California retrofit standards.

**Deficiency 2: Unbraced Cripple Walls**

**Problem:** Short stud walls in crawl spaces lack structural sheathing, allowing collapse during seismic events.

**Solution:** Installation of structural plywood sheathing on cripple walls with proper nailing, blocking, and connections to foundation and floor above.

**Deficiency 3: Weak Garage Openings**

**Problem:** Large garage door openings reduce lateral resistance on building front walls.

**Solution:** Steel moment frames or other reinforcement providing lateral resistance at garage openings.
