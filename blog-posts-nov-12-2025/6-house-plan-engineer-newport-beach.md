Services include cantilevered retaining walls, segmental block walls (decorative concrete block), soldier pile walls for steep cuts, site walls and fences (structural support), and landscape terracing systems.

## How Does the House Plan Engineering Process Work in Newport Beach?

**Direct Answer:**
The Newport Beach house plan engineering process typically takes 6-12 weeks from initial consultation to permit-ready plans for custom homes, with major renovations taking 4-8 weeks. The process includes property assessment and program review, preliminary structural design and coordination with architect, detailed engineering and structural calculations, construction document preparation, PE stamping and quality review, City of Newport Beach and Coastal Commission submittal (if applicable), plan check response and revisions, and construction phase support. Newport Beach projects require exceptional attention to detail, thorough documentation, and often extensive coordination with multiple consultants and review agencies.

**Phase 1: Property Assessment & Program (Weeks 1-2)**

We review architectural plans and project vision, visit property to assess site conditions, review geotechnical report (soils and foundations), identify applicable regulations (Coastal Commission, HOA, city), and discuss budget and schedule expectations.

**Newport Beach Considerations:**
- Coastal Zone determination (some areas require Coastal Commission approval)
- HOA architectural review requirements (most Newport neighborhoods)
- Waterfront or oceanfront special conditions
- Hillside ordinance applicability (Newport Coast)
- Property value and appropriate quality level

**Phase 2: Preliminary Structural Design (Weeks 2-4)**

We develop conceptual structural systems, coordinate with architect on structural grid and elements, identify long-span solutions and special structural needs, select foundation system based on soils, and prepare preliminary engineering budget.

**Newport Beach Design Features:**
- Open floor plans requiring long spans (30-40 feet common)
- Ocean views requiring minimal structural obstruction
- Rooftop decks and outdoor living spaces
- High-end finishes requiring structural support
- Architectural features (cantilevers, large overhangs)
