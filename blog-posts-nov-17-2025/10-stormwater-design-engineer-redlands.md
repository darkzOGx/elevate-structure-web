**Updated: November 2025**

Stormwater design engineers provide specialized civil engineering services managing rainfall runoff, preventing flooding, protecting water quality, and ensuring regulatory compliance throughout Redlands, San Bernardino, Yucaipa, and the Inland Empire. Our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with over 20 years of combined experience understand how stormwater engineers design drainage systems, calculate runoff volumes, size conveyance infrastructure, design water quality treatment facilities, and navigate complex California stormwater regulations protecting rivers, streams, and groundwater serving Redlands' 72,000 residents in this historic foothill city. Whether you're considering a stormwater engineering career, developing property requiring stormwater management, or understanding this growing profession, recognizing stormwater engineer roles ensures successful project planning, regulatory compliance, and environmental protection.

Redlands' unique character—combining historic downtown areas, residential neighborhoods, citrus heritage, and foothill topography near the San Bernardino Mountains with median home values around $580,000—creates diverse stormwater challenges requiring specialized engineering expertise. The city's rainfall patterns (averaging 16 inches annually, with most precipitation November through March), varied topography from valley floor to mountain foothills, and sensitive watershed areas demand comprehensive [civil engineering services](/services/civil-engineering) addressing both flood control and water quality protection. Understanding stormwater design engineer responsibilities, required expertise, and career pathways helps students, professionals, and property developers navigate California's increasingly complex stormwater regulatory environment.

## What Is a Stormwater Design Engineer and What Do They Do?

**Direct Answer:**
A stormwater design engineer is a civil engineer specializing in managing rainfall runoff through drainage system design, flood control infrastructure, water quality treatment facilities, and erosion control systems. In California, stormwater engineers calculate rainfall and runoff using hydrology, design pipes and channels using hydraulics, create stormwater quality Best Management Practices (BMPs) meeting Regional Water Quality Control Board requirements, prepare construction stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPPs), and ensure compliance with MS4 permits and local drainage ordinances. Licensed PEs stamp stormwater plans for building permits while unlicensed engineers work under PE supervision gaining experience toward licensure.

Stormwater engineering represents a specialized subset of civil engineering requiring expertise beyond general site development knowledge. While all civil engineers learn basic hydrology and hydraulics, stormwater specialists develop deep understanding of:
- Advanced hydrology and rainfall-runoff modeling
- Hydraulic design of complex drainage systems
- Water quality treatment processes and BMP technologies
- California stormwater regulations (Regional Water Quality Control Board orders, MS4 permits, Construction General Permit)
- Low Impact Development (LID) and sustainable drainage approaches
- Erosion and sediment control during construction
- Floodplain management and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requirements
- Long-term stormwater facility maintenance and performance

California's environmental leadership drives some of the nation's most stringent stormwater regulations. The state's Mediterranean climate with distinct wet and dry seasons, limited water resources, and water quality challenges in many water bodies necessitate sophisticated stormwater management preventing pollution and protecting beneficial uses.

In Redlands specifically, stormwater engineers work on:
- **New development projects** requiring drainage systems and water quality treatment throughout Redlands' growing areas
- **Redevelopment projects** in historic downtown and established neighborhoods meeting current stormwater standards
- **Municipal infrastructure** including street improvements, storm drain systems, and flood control facilities
- **Hillside development** in areas near San Timoteo Canyon and mountain foothills with complex drainage patterns
- **Industrial facilities** requiring specialized stormwater pollution prevention
- **Post-fire watershed protection** in areas affected by recent wildfires (San Bernardino National Forest proximity)

Understanding [types of engineering design](/blog/types-of-engineering-design-ontario) helps clarify how stormwater engineering fits within broader civil engineering disciplines and coordinates with structural, geotechnical, and environmental engineering specialties.

## What Are the Primary Responsibilities of Stormwater Design Engineers?

**Direct Answer:**
Stormwater design engineers' primary responsibilities include performing hydrologic calculations determining rainfall and runoff volumes, conducting hydraulic analysis sizing drainage pipes and channels, designing stormwater quality Best Management Practices (bioretention, infiltration, filters), preparing construction stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPPs), ensuring compliance with Regional Water Quality Control Board requirements, coordinating with municipalities and regulatory agencies, conducting site drainage evaluations, designing flood control and detention facilities, and preparing PE-stamped plans enabling building permits. In California, stormwater engineers must understand complex regulations including Construction General Permit, MS4 permits, and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements affecting project design.

**Hydrologic Analysis and Calculations**

**Rainfall Analysis:**
Determining design storm characteristics for Redlands projects:
- Historical rainfall data analysis for San Bernardino County
- Design storm selection (2-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, 100-year return periods)
- Rainfall intensity calculations using intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves
- Temporal rainfall distribution (how rainfall varies during storms)
- Redlands receives approximately 16 inches annual rainfall, with extreme events exceeding 3 inches in 24 hours

**Runoff Calculations:**
Estimating how much rainfall becomes runoff:
- Watershed delineation identifying drainage areas
- Runoff coefficient determination based on land use and surface types
- Time of concentration calculations (how long water takes to reach outlet)
- Peak flow calculations using Rational Method (for small watersheds) or Unit Hydrograph methods (for larger watersheds)
- Runoff volume calculations for detention and water quality design

Redlands' varied topography—from relatively flat valley areas to steep foothill slopes—dramatically affects runoff patterns. Steep slopes generate faster runoff with higher peak flows, while flatter areas allow more infiltration and slower response.

**Hydraulic Design and Analysis**

**Storm Drain System Design:**
Sizing pipes, inlets, and appurtenances:
- Pipe sizing ensuring adequate capacity for design storms
- Hydraulic grade line analysis verifying pipes flow freely without surcharging
- Inlet design and spacing providing adequate surface drainage
- Manhole sizing and spacing for maintenance access
- Energy dissipation at outfalls preventing erosion

**Open Channel Design:**
Natural and constructed drainage channels:
- Channel sizing providing adequate flow capacity
- Bank stabilization preventing erosion
- Channel lining selection (grass, riprap, concrete) based on velocity and flow conditions
- Grade control structures preventing channel degradation
- Environmental considerations (habitat, aesthetics, water quality)

Redlands' historic storm drain systems date to early 1900s in some downtown areas, requiring engineers to understand existing infrastructure capacity and limitations when designing improvements or connecting new development.

**Detention and Retention Basin Design:**
Temporary storage controlling peak flows:
- Volume calculations based on pre-development vs. post-development runoff
- Outlet structure design (orifices, weirs) controlling release rates
- Emergency overflow spillways for extreme events
- Basin grading and geometry
- Maintenance access and long-term operation considerations

**Software Tools:**
Modern stormwater engineers use specialized software:
- HydroCAD, StormCAD, or SWMM for complex drainage modeling
- Rational Method spreadsheets for simple calculations
- AutoCAD Civil 3D for drainage system layout and design
- GIS tools for watershed analysis and mapping

**Water Quality BMP Design**

California's focus on stormwater quality protection drives substantial engineering effort:

**Low Impact Development (LID) Approaches:**
Mimicking natural hydrology through distributed small-scale features:
- **Bioretention areas (rain gardens):** Landscaped depressions collecting and infiltrating runoff while providing water quality treatment
- **Permeable pavements:** Allowing runoff to infiltrate through pavement surface into underlying storage/infiltration layers
- **Vegetated swales:** Grass-lined channels providing conveyance and treatment
- **Tree well filters:** Street trees with engineered soil media treating runoff
- **Green roofs:** Vegetated roof systems reducing runoff and providing treatment

**Proprietary Treatment Devices:**
Manufactured systems for constrained sites:
- Hydrodynamic separators using vortex action to separate pollutants
- Media filters passing runoff through sand or other treatment media
- Vault-based systems with settling and filtration chambers
- Maintenance requirements and pollutant removal performance

**Design Process:**
- Sizing BMPs based on runoff volume from design storms
- Ensuring adequate pollutant removal meeting regulatory requirements
- Designing underdrains, overflows, and hydraulic controls
- Specifying soil media, vegetation, and materials
- Detailing construction specifications
- Preparing maintenance plans for long-term performance

Redlands' soil conditions—ranging from sandy loams with good infiltration to heavy clays with poor infiltration—significantly affect BMP selection and design. Our [grading and drainage engineering experience](/blog/grading-drainage-plans-poway) integrates stormwater quality features with overall site development.

- Designing construction BMPs (silt fences, fiber rolls, stabilized entrances, inlet protection)
- Specifying erosion control measures (hydroseeding, erosion control blankets, tackifiers)
- Developing monitoring and inspection programs
- Training requirements for contractors

**Post-Construction Requirements:**
Projects creating or replacing 5,000+ square feet of impervious surface trigger post-construction stormwater management:
- Designing treatment BMPs meeting pollutant removal requirements
- Volume-based or flow-based treatment design
- LID feasibility assessment and implementation
- Long-term maintenance provisions and responsible parties
- Operation and maintenance manuals

**MS4 Permit Compliance:**
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System permits regulate discharges to public storm drains:
- Understanding local jurisdiction requirements (City of Redlands MS4 permit)
- Designing projects meeting MS4 permit conditions
- Demonstrating compliance through calculations and documentation
- Coordinating with city public works departments

**Site Drainage Evaluation and Problem-Solving**

**Existing Condition Assessment:**
Understanding current drainage patterns and problems:
- Site visits documenting existing drainage
- Observing evidence of flooding, erosion, or poor drainage
- Evaluating existing infrastructure condition and capacity
- Identifying constraints affecting drainage design
- Reviewing historical drainage problems from city records or neighbors

**Problem Diagnosis:**
