## What Is a Design Engineer and What Do They Do?

**Direct Answer:**
A design engineer is a licensed or unlicensed professional who creates detailed technical plans, specifications, and calculations for construction projects, products, or systems within their engineering discipline. In California construction, design engineers work under Professional Engineer supervision performing structural analysis, preparing construction drawings, designing building systems, calculating loads and capacities, selecting materials and components, and coordinating with other disciplines. Entry-level design engineers assist senior engineers with calculations and drafting, while experienced design engineers independently manage project technical aspects under PE review before plan stamping and certification.

Design engineering differs from pure research engineering or field engineering. Research engineers develop new technologies, materials, or methods. Field engineers work on construction sites managing implementation. Design engineers occupy the middle ground—applying established engineering principles and building codes to create specific project designs transforming abstract concepts into concrete reality.

In Chino and the broader Inland Empire, design engineers work on:
- **Residential projects** including single-family homes, multi-family developments, ADUs, and residential additions throughout Chino's growing neighborhoods
