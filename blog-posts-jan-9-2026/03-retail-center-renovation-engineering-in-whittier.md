## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do all tenant improvements need structural engineering?

Not all TI projects require structural engineering. Cosmetic changes, furniture installation, and minor modifications typically don't need engineering. However, any work affecting structure—wall removals, floor cuts, mezzanine additions, or heavy equipment installation—requires PE-stamped plans. When in doubt, consult with engineers before committing to construction timelines.

### How long does retail TI engineering take?

Simple tenant improvements with partition changes typically require 2-3 weeks for engineering, plus 2-4 weeks for Whittier plan check. More complex projects with structural modifications may need 4-6 weeks for engineering. Fast-track projects can compress timelines with additional resources. Discuss timeline requirements with engineers during project initiation.

### What triggers seismic upgrade requirements during renovation?

Major triggers include substantial improvement (work exceeding 50% of building value), change of occupancy to higher hazard classification, and structural alterations affecting more than 30 square feet of building area. Minor tenant improvements typically don't trigger seismic upgrades. Engineers can assess whether proposed work triggers upgrade requirements.

### Can we remove walls in retail spaces without engineering?

Removing any wall requires engineering evaluation to determine if it's load-bearing. Load-bearing wall removal requires PE-stamped plans showing temporary support, permanent header or beam design, and load path to foundation. Non-load-bearing demising walls may also require permits for fire separation and utility coordination. Never remove walls without engineering verification.

### How much does mezzanine engineering cost?

Mezzanine engineering for retail spaces typically costs $5,000-$15,000 depending on size and complexity. This includes structural design, connection details, code compliance verification, and permit-ready drawings. Mezzanines also require egress analysis, fire rating consideration, and building official approval of increased floor area.

### What about rooftop equipment additions?

Rooftop equipment additions require structural engineering to verify roof capacity, design equipment supports, and ensure lateral bracing adequacy. Engineering typically costs $3,000-$8,000 for straightforward additions. Older roofs may require strengthening to accommodate new equipment loads.

### Do facade renovations need structural engineering?

Most facade renovations require structural engineering for cladding attachment design, wind load analysis, and coordination with existing structure. Even lightweight facade systems impose significant loads requiring engineered connections. Facade engineering typically costs $10,000-$40,000 depending on system complexity and building size.

### How do we handle renovations without original drawings?

When original drawings aren't available, engineers conduct field investigations to document existing conditions. This may include exposed structure observation, non-destructive testing, and limited destructive investigation. Investigation costs add to project engineering but are essential for safe renovation design. Budget additional time and cost for documentation development.
