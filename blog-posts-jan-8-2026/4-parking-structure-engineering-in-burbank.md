Parking structure engineering presents unique challenges that combine sophisticated concrete design with demanding durability requirements throughout Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, and the greater Los Angeles area. Our licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of combined experience specialize in parking garage structural design—from simple surface parking structures to complex multi-level facilities—that meets California's rigorous seismic requirements while providing long-term serviceability and low maintenance costs. Understanding parking structure engineering is essential for developers, property owners, and municipalities planning parking infrastructure in Southern California's competitive real estate market.

Burbank's thriving media industry, expanding downtown, and proximity to Hollywood have created intense demand for parking infrastructure. From studio lots to mixed-use developments near the Metrolink station, effective parking structure design optimizes land use while accommodating the high seismic loads, vehicle impacts, and environmental exposure that make parking garages some of the most challenging structures to engineer.

## What Is Parking Structure Engineering?

**Direct Answer:** Parking structure engineering involves the specialized design of buildings or structures dedicated to vehicle parking, requiring expertise in concrete construction, post-tensioning systems, durability design, and seismic force-resisting systems. This engineering discipline addresses unique challenges including heavy concentrated wheel loads, corrosive environments from vehicle fluids and de-icing salts, ramping systems, and the need for economical, open floor plans with minimal columns to maximize parking efficiency.

Parking structures represent a distinct building type with requirements that differ significantly from typical commercial buildings. The combination of exposed conditions, vehicle impacts, moving loads, and long spans creates demanding design constraints that require specialized expertise.

**Key Parking Structure Types:**

**Above-Grade Parking Garages**
Free-standing structures with multiple levels, typically cast-in-place or precast concrete. These provide the highest parking density for surface area but require significant structural investment.

**Podium Parking Structures**
Parking levels beneath residential or commercial development, integrated into mixed-use projects. Common in urban infill development throughout Burbank's downtown.

**Subterranean Parking**
Below-grade parking beneath buildings, requiring specialized waterproofing and drainage. Increasingly common for high-value commercial and residential projects.

**Surface Parking Structures**
Single-level covered parking with roof systems, providing weather protection without multi-level construction costs.

Our [structural engineering services](/services/structural-engineering) encompass all parking structure types from preliminary feasibility through construction administration.
