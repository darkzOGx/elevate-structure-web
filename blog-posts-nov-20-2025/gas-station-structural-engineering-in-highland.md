# Gas Station Structural Engineering in Highland: Complete 2025 Design Guide

**Updated: November 2025**

Designing a gas station or fuel facility in Highland, California requires specialized structural engineering to handle large canopy structures, underground storage tank (UST) installations, fuel dispenser islands, convenience store buildings, and strict petroleum facility regulations. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about gas station structural engineering in Highland and San Bernardino County's Inland Empire region.

As part of our [comprehensive commercial and industrial structural engineering services](/blog/commercial-industrial-structural-engineering-guide), we specialize in petroleum facility design throughout Southern California, including Highland, San Bernardino, Redlands, and Yucaipa. Highland's strategic location at the intersection of Interstate 210 and major state highways, combined with a growing population of over 55,000 residents, makes it a prime location for modern fuel retail facilities.

## What is Gas Station Structural Engineering?

Gas station structural engineering is the specialized practice of designing structural systems for automotive fuel retail facilities, including fuel dispensing areas, canopy structures, convenience stores, and underground storage tank installations. These projects present unique challenges that differentiate them from standard commercial buildings:

**Large Canopy Structures**: Modern fuel canopies span 80 to 150+ feet with minimal support columns to maximize vehicle access and visibility. These structures must support their own weight plus significant wind uplift forces, equipment loads (lighting, signage, HVAC), and snow loads, all while maintaining architectural aesthetics for brand identity.

**Underground Storage Tanks (USTs)**: Fuel storage tanks ranging from 8,000 to 30,000+ gallons each must be installed underground with proper structural excavation support, tank embedment, and protection from traffic loads above. Tank vaults must be designed to prevent flotation from high groundwater and resist earth pressures.

**Fuel Dispenser Islands**: Concrete islands housing fuel dispensers must be designed for vehicle impact resistance, proper anchoring of dispensers and payment terminals, and integration with underground fuel piping. These structures require specialized reinforcement and details to handle accidental impacts.

**High Vehicle Traffic Loads**: Gas station pavements and drive areas experience constant heavy traffic—passenger vehicles, delivery trucks, fuel tanker trucks (80,000 lbs gross vehicle weight). Structural design must account for repetitive loading, turning movements, and tanker truck access to fill ports.

**Seismic and Wind Loads**: California's high seismic activity and Highland's wind exposure require rigorous analysis of canopy structures, sign pylons, and attached equipment. Large canopy structures act as "sails" during wind events, creating substantial uplift and overturning forces.

**Stringent Regulations**: Gas stations are subject to multiple regulatory agencies—local building departments, fire marshals, environmental health, California State Fire Marshal (petroleum safety), and US EPA (underground storage tank regulations). Structural design must comply with all applicable codes and standards.

In Highland, where gas stations serve both local traffic and Interstate 210 commuters, proper structural engineering is critical for safety, regulatory compliance, brand consistency, and long-term operational reliability.

## Gas Station Structural Requirements in Highland

### Building Code Requirements

Highland, as an incorporated city in San Bernardino County, follows the **2022 California Building Code (CBC)** with local amendments:

**Occupancy Classification**:
- **Fuel canopy area**: Group H-2 (High Hazard - Moderate Hazard) per CBC Section 307.4 for flammable fuel dispensing, or Group U (Utility/Miscellaneous) if canopy is open-air without enclosed spaces
- **Convenience store**: Group M (Mercantile) per CBC Section 309
- **Car wash or service area**: Group F-2 (Factory/Industrial - Low Hazard) per CBC Section 306.3
- **Food service area**: Group A-2 (Assembly) for restaurant seating per CBC Section 303

Mixed-use gas station/convenience store facilities are common in Highland and require compliance with CBC Section 508 for multiple occupancies or proper separation.

**Live Load Requirements** (CBC Table 1607.1):
- **Canopy structure**: 20 psf minimum live load (snow/maintenance access)
- **Convenience store floors**: 40-60 psf (retail/business occupancy)
- **Storage rooms**: 125 psf
- **Sidewalks and plaza areas**: 60 psf uniform, 200 lbs concentrated

**Vehicle Live Loads** (ASCE 7-22 Section 4.10):

## Critical Structural Considerations for Highland Gas Stations

### Fuel Canopy Structure Design

The fuel canopy is the most complex and critical structural element:

**Canopy Sizing and Configuration**:
- **Typical dimensions**:
  - Small station: 60-80 ft × 30-40 ft (2-3 dispenser islands)
  - Medium station: 100-120 ft × 40-50 ft (4-6 dispenser islands)
  - Large station: 120-150+ ft × 50-60 ft (6-8+ dispenser islands)
- **Height**: 14-18 ft clear height minimum (accommodate tall vehicles, RVs, trucks)
- **Column spacing**: 30-50 ft typical (maximize vehicle access and visibility)
- **Cantilevers**: 10-20 ft overhangs beyond columns common

**Structural Systems**:

1. **Steel Frame Canopy** (Most Common):
   - **Columns**: Wide-flange (W) sections or hollow structural steel (HSS) tubes, typically 12" to 24" deep
   - **Beams/Girders**: W-sections spanning between columns, 18" to 36" deep
   - **Roof framing**: Bar joists or tube steel purlins
   - **Roof deck**: Metal decking (22-20 gauge), plywood, or standing seam metal roof
   - **Fascia**: Architectural metal panels with integrated lighting
   - **Typical cost**: $45-$75 per sq ft of canopy area

2. **Concrete and Steel Hybrid**:
   - Reinforced concrete columns (decorative, durable)
   - Steel beams and roof framing
   - Common for branded stations (architectural appearance)
   - **Typical cost**: $60-$90 per sq ft

3. **Pre-Engineered Systems**:
   - Proprietary canopy systems from manufacturers (Exxon, Chevron, etc.)
   - Factory-fabricated components
   - Standardized details for brand consistency
   - Engineer provides site-specific foundation design and verifies code compliance

**Load Analysis**:

**Dead Loads**:
- Canopy structure self-weight: 10-20 psf
- Roofing: 3-8 psf
- Lighting and electrical: 3-5 psf
- HVAC (if enclosed): 2-5 psf
- Signage and fascia: 5-15 psf
- **Total dead load: 25-50 psf typical**

**Live Loads**:
- **Roof live load**: 20 psf minimum (CBC Table 1607.1 for canopies)
- **Maintenance/access**: 100 psf concentrated load
- **Snow load** (Highland): 15-25 psf ground snow load, reduced per ASCE 7-22 (5-15 psf typical on canopy)

**Wind Loads** (Critical for Canopies):
- **Design wind pressure**: 20-35 psf on projected canopy area (varies with height, exposure, building configuration)
- **Uplift**: Wind creates negative pressure on underside of canopy—can exceed gravity loads
- **Net uplift**: Column design typically governed by uplift (tension) rather than compression
- **Overturning**: Large canopies act as "sails"—foundation design must resist overturning moment

**Example - 100 ft × 40 ft Canopy in Highland**:
- Dead load: 30 psf × 4,000 sq ft = 120,000 lbs (60 kips)
- Wind uplift: 25 psf × 4,000 sq ft = 100,000 lbs (50 kips)
- Net uplift: 50 kips - 60 kips = **-10 kips** (still downward, but close)
- With load factors (1.0D - 1.6W): **Columns in tension!** Must design column connections for uplift

**Connection Design**:
- Base plates anchored to concrete foundations with anchor bolts
- **Anchor bolts**: 1" to 1.5" diameter, 18-30" embedment typical
- Design for tension (uplift), shear (lateral wind/seismic)
- Moment-resisting connections if required for lateral system
- Exposed bases require corrosion protection (galvanizing, protective coatings)

**Seismic Design**:
- Canopy structure must meet CBC seismic requirements
- **Lateral system**: Moment frames, braced frames, or cantilever columns
- Open canopies limit bracing options—often use moment connections
- Design for lateral forces in both directions
- Flexible utility connections to accommodate seismic drift

**Corrosion Protection**:
- All steel exposed to weather: hot-dip galvanized or painted with high-performance coatings
- Fuel vapors and vehicle emissions accelerate corrosion
- Anchor bolts and embedded steel: galvanized or stainless steel
- Regular inspection and maintenance critical

### Underground Storage Tank (UST) Installation

UST installation requires careful structural planning:

**Tank Sizing**:
- **Typical gas station**: 3-5 tanks totaling 40,000-80,000 gallons
  - Regular gasoline: 12,000-20,000 gallons
  - Plus/Premium gasoline: 10,000-15,000 gallons
  - Diesel: 10,000-15,000 gallons
  - Reserve capacity: Often 1 or 2 additional tanks
- **Large stations**: 80,000-150,000+ gallons total capacity

**Tank Vault Design**:

**Excavation**:
- Depth: 10-14 ft typical (tank height 8-10 ft + 2-4 ft cover)
- Width/length: Depends on number and orientation of tanks, typically 15-30 ft wide × 30-60 ft long
- **Excavation support**: Shoring or sloped excavation required during construction per OSHA standards
- **Dewatering**: Required if groundwater encountered (rare in Highland due to deep water table)

**Structural Backfill**:
- USTs must be embedded in proper backfill material for support and corrosion protection
- **Backfill material**: Clean sand (max 1/4" to 1/2" size) or pea gravel
- **Compaction**: 90-95% relative density
- **Bedding**: 6-12 inch clean sand layer beneath tanks
- **Cover**: Minimum 12 inches clean sand above tanks before general backfill

**Tank Anchorage**:
- **Flotation prevention**: Tanks are buoyant when empty and groundwater is present
- Highland typically has deep groundwater (>30 ft), so flotation rarely an issue
- If high groundwater possible: Tanks anchored to concrete deadmen or held down with reinforced concrete straps
- **Seismic restraint**: Tanks must resist sliding and overturning during earthquakes
  - Tank-to-pipe connections designed for seismic movement (flexible joints)

**Structural Loading Above Tanks**:
- **Soil cover**: Minimum 2-3 ft above tanks to distribution loads
- **Traffic loads**: Design for HS-20 truck loads (80,000 lb tanker trucks driving over tanks)
- **Pavement design**:
  - Asphalt: 4-6 inches over 6-8 inches aggregate base (AB)
  - Concrete: 6-8 inches reinforced concrete
- **Load distribution**: Traffic loads spread through soil to tank—adequate cover critical

**Tank Access and Monitoring**:
- **Fill ports**: Secure access for tanker truck filling, bollard protection
- **Vapor recovery**: Required in California, separate piping system
- **Monitoring wells**: Interstitial monitoring, groundwater monitoring
- **Electrical**: Leak detection sensors, submersible pumps (turbine pumps inside tanks)

### Fuel Dispenser Island Design

Dispenser islands are safety-critical structures:

**Island Configuration**:
- **Size**: Typically 4-6 ft wide × 20-50 ft long
- **Height**: 6-8 inches above pavement (per CBC Section 406.6.3—protect dispensers from vehicle impacts)
- **Spacing**: 12-14 ft between parallel islands (vehicle access)
- **Layout**: Angled islands improve traffic flow and capacity

**Structural Design**:

**Concrete Construction**:
- **Slab thickness**: 8-12 inches reinforced concrete
- **Reinforcement**: #4 or #5 rebar at 12" o.c. each way minimum, top and bottom layers
- **Concrete strength**: 3,500-4,000 psi
- **Perimeter curb**: 6-8 inch tall curb, integral with slab or separate formed curb

**Foundation**:
- **Base course**: 6-8 inches compacted aggregate base
- **Subgrade**: Compacted native soil or engineered fill (95% compaction minimum)
- **Frost protection**: Highland rarely freezes, but minimum 12 inch depth below grade recommended

**Dispenser Anchorage**:
- Fuel dispensers anchored to island slab
- **Anchor bolts**: 3/4" or 1" diameter, 12-18" embedment
- Design for dispenser weight plus accidental impact loads
- **Bollards** or protective posts required around dispensers (per Fire Code and petroleum regulations)

**Underground Utilities**:
- Fuel piping from USTs to dispensers
- Electrical conduits for dispenser power and payment systems
- Vapor recovery piping
- All embedded in island slab or beneath island
- **Flexible connections**: Accommodate settlement, thermal movement, seismic displacement

**Containment Sumps**:
- Required under dispensers and at pipe connections
- Containment sumps detect leaks and prevent soil contamination
- Must be structurally supported within island construction

**Impact Resistance**:
- Islands designed for vehicle impact (errant vehicles, careless drivers)
- Reinforcement prevents slab breakup
- Bollards protect dispensers from direct impact
- Some jurisdictions require crash-rated bollards

### Site Pavement Design

Gas station pavements must handle heavy loads and constant traffic:

**Pavement Loading**:
- **Passenger vehicles**: 4,000-8,000 lbs, repetitive loading
- **Fuel delivery trucks**: Up to 80,000 lbs gross vehicle weight
- **Pavement design**: Must resist rutting, cracking, and failure under repetitive heavy loads

**Asphalt Pavement Design** (Most Common):
- **Asphalt thickness**: 4-6 inches (residential access), 6-8 inches (heavy truck traffic)
- **Base course**: 6-12 inches aggregate base (Class II AB), compacted to 95%
- **Subgrade**: Compacted native soil to 90-95% relative compaction
- **Total section**: Typically 12-18 inches
- **R-value testing**: Soils tested for bearing capacity (R-value), used in pavement design calculations
- **Typical cost**: $5-$9 per sq ft

**Concrete Pavement Design**:
- Used for high-traffic areas, tanker truck routes, drive-over tank areas
- **Slab thickness**: 6-8 inches reinforced concrete
- **Reinforcement**: WWF (6×6-W2.9×W2.9) or #4 rebar at 18" o.c.
- **Joints**: 15-20 ft spacing, saw-cut control joints
- **Concrete strength**: 3,000-3,500 psi
- **Typical cost**: $8-$14 per sq ft

**Highland Soil Considerations**:
- **Soil type**: Alluvial deposits, decomposed granite in elevated areas
- **Bearing capacity**: Typically moderate to good (R-value 30-60)
- **Expansive soils**: Some areas may have expansive clay—requires deeper base course or soil stabilization
- **Geotechnical investigation**: Recommended to determine pavement section design

### Convenience Store Building

Most modern gas stations include convenience stores:

**Building Type**:
- **Size**: 2,000-5,000 sq ft typical
- **Construction**:
  - **Wood frame** (most economical): 2×6 studs, engineered trusses
  - **Steel frame**: Pre-engineered metal building or conventional steel
  - **Masonry**: CMU or tilt-up concrete (larger stores)

**Structural Requirements**:
- **Foundation**: Slab-on-grade with thickened edges (18-24" deep) typical
- **Floor loading**: 40-60 psf for retail areas, 125 psf for storage
- **Roof loading**: 20 psf live + snow load + dead load
- **Lateral system**: Shear walls or moment frames for seismic and wind

**Special Considerations**:
- **Refrigerated walk-in coolers**: Heavy floor loading (300-500 psf), requires special footing or slab reinforcement
- **Shelving**: High-density merchandise creates higher-than-code floor loads in aisles
- **Food service**: If restaurant or hot food service, consider grease interceptor (affects site utilities)
- **Signage**: Pylon signs (30-60 ft tall) require separate structural design and foundation

## Common Gas Station Structural Challenges in Highland

### Challenge #1: Wind Uplift on Large Canopies

Highland's wind exposure creates significant uplift forces on fuel canopies:

**Problem**: Wind flowing under and over canopy creates negative pressure (suction) on underside, lifting canopy upward. This uplift can exceed gravity loads, putting canopy columns in tension and creating uplift forces on foundations.

**Solutions**:

1. **Design columns for tension**:
   - Base plate connections designed for uplift (anchor bolts in tension)
   - Larger and deeper anchor bolts (1" to 1.5" diameter, 24-36" embedment)
   - Verify concrete breakout strength exceeds applied tension

2. **Foundation design for uplift**:
   - Spread footings must be large and deep enough to resist uplift
   - Typical canopy footing: 4-6 ft square × 3-4 ft deep
   - Weight of footing and soil above contributes to resisting uplift
   - In extreme cases, add deadmen or helical piles

3. **Structural analysis**:
   - Detailed wind analysis per ASCE 7-22
   - Consider wind from all directions
   - Account for building shielding effects
   - Load combinations with reduced live loads per CBC Section 1605.3

4. **Column design**:
   - HSS columns perform well in tension
   - Wide-flange columns require base plate designed to transfer tension to anchor bolts
   - Verify column-to-base connection capacity

**Example - Canopy Column in Highland**:
- Wind uplift: 25 psf
- Tributary area: 1,200 sq ft (30' × 40' column spacing)
- Total uplift: 30,000 lbs
- Dead load: 35 psf × 1,200 sq ft = 42,000 lbs
- Load combination (0.6D - 1.0W): 0.6 × 42k - 1.0 × 30k = **-4,800 lbs (uplift)**
- Design anchor bolts for 4,800 lbs tension plus shear

### Challenge #2: Differential Settlement Around Underground Storage Tanks

Soil disturbance from UST excavation can cause settlement issues:

**Problem**: Large excavation for tanks (15-30 ft wide, 30-60 ft long, 10-14 ft deep) removes significant soil. Backfill, even when compacted, often settles more than undisturbed soil, causing pavement cracking and utility breaks above tank area.

**Solutions**:

1. **Proper backfill material and compaction**:
   - Use clean, well-graded sand or gravel (not clay or organic soil)
   - Compact in 12-inch lifts to 95% relative density
   - Test compaction with nuclear densometer or sand cone
   - Extra effort during backfilling prevents long-term settlement

2. **Overexcavation and replacement**:
   - Excavate 6-12 inches below tanks and replace with compacted material
   - Provides uniform bearing, reduces future settlement

3. **Transition zones**:
   - Provide gradual transitions between tank vault area and undisturbed areas
   - Taper pavement thickness or add additional base course at edges of tank vault

4. **Pavement design over tanks**:
   - Use concrete pavement over tank area (less susceptible to settlement than asphalt)
   - Or use thicker asphalt section (add 2-4 inches extra)
   - Allow 3-6 months for settlement before final paving (if schedule permits)

5. **Flexible utility connections**:
   - All piping and conduits crossing tank vault edges should have flexible joints
   - Prevents breaks due to differential settlement

### Challenge #3: Coordinating Multiple Underground Utilities

Gas stations have extensive underground utilities in limited space:

**Problem**: Underground fuel piping, electrical conduits, water lines, sewer laterals, stormwater piping, and monitoring wells all compete for space beneath pavement. Poor coordination causes conflicts during construction and costly re-work.

**Solutions**:

1. **Comprehensive utility plan**:
   - Create detailed plan showing all underground utilities in 3D (plan view and elevations)
   - Coordinate early with civil engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer
   - Identify conflicts and resolve during design, not construction

2. **Utility separation**:
   - Maintain minimum separation distances per code:
     - Fuel lines: 12-18 inches from water lines, 6 inches from other utilities
     - Electrical: 12 inches from other utilities
   - Use directional drilling or boring for utilities beneath existing structures

3. **Sequential construction**:
   - Install deepest utilities first (sanitary sewer, typically 6-8 ft deep)
   - Then fuel lines (typically 3-5 ft deep)
   - Then electrical and monitoring (typically 2-3 ft deep)
   - Finally pavement and surface structures

4. **Utility corridor concept**:
   - Designate specific zones for utilities
   - Route utilities parallel when possible, reduce crossing
   - Provide access points for future maintenance

### Challenge #4: High Seismic Loads on Pylon Signs

Tall pylon signs are vulnerable to earthquake damage:

**Problem**: Highland gas stations typically have 30-60 ft tall pylon signs (monument signs) for highway visibility. These tall structures with large sign faces create significant seismic lateral loads and overturning moments.

**Solutions**:

1. **Rigorous structural design**:
   - Analyze sign structure for seismic loads per CBC Section 1609.1.1.3
   - Design for wind and seismic loads
   - Use appropriate response modification factor (R = 3 for cantilevered signs per ASCE 7-22)
   - Taller signs = higher seismic forces

2. **Foundation design**:
   - Large spread footings: 6-10 ft square × 4-6 ft deep typical for 40-60 ft signs
   - Must resist overturning moment and prevent rotation
   - In poor soils, may require drilled piers or helical piles
   - Anchor bolts: 1.25" to 1.75" diameter, deep embedment

3. **Sign structure**:
   - Steel tube or W-section monopole
   - Heavier sections at base, lighter at top
   - Base plate connection designed for moment, shear, and tension/compression
   - Galvanized or painted for corrosion protection

4. **Face attachment**:
   - Sign faces must be securely attached and not break loose during earthquake
   - Design support framing for lateral loads
   - Use through-bolts or welded connections (not adhesives alone)

**Example - 50-ft Pylon Sign in Highland**:
- Sign face: 12 ft × 20 ft (both sides) = 480 sq ft total
- Wind load: 25-35 psf (varies with height and exposure)
- Total wind force: ~12,000-15,000 lbs
- Overturning moment at base: 300,000-450,000 ft-lbs
- Footing: 8' × 8' × 5' deep reinforced concrete, 15-20 tons, resists overturning

## FAQs: Gas Station Structural Engineering in Highland

**Q: Do I need a structural engineer for my Highland gas station?**
A: Yes. City of Highland requires sealed structural plans from a licensed California engineer for all gas stations. The complexity of canopies, underground storage tanks, and petroleum facility regulations makes professional engineering essential.

**Q: How much does a gas station canopy weigh?**
A: Typical steel canopy: 25-50 psf of canopy area. A 100' × 40' canopy weighs approximately 50,000-80,000 lbs (25-40 tons). However, wind uplift forces can exceed this weight, putting columns in tension.

**Q: Can wind lift a gas station canopy off its foundation?**
A: Yes, if not properly designed. Wind creates uplift (negative pressure) on canopy underside. In Highland's wind climate, uplift can exceed canopy weight. Proper design includes adequate anchor bolts and foundation weight to resist uplift.

**Q: How deep are underground storage tanks?**
A: Typically 10-14 ft below grade. Tanks themselves are 8-10 ft tall; minimum 2-3 ft of soil cover required above tanks for load distribution and protection.

**Q: Do underground tanks float?**
A: Empty tanks can float if groundwater is high. Highland typically has deep groundwater (>30 ft), so flotation rarely an issue. In high groundwater areas, tanks must be anchored to deadmen or weighted down.

**Q: How big are gas station foundations?**
A: Varies by structure:
- **Canopy column footings**: 4-6 ft square × 3-4 ft deep typical
- **Pylon sign foundation**: 6-10 ft square × 4-6 ft deep for 40-60 ft signs
- **Convenience store**: Slab-on-grade with 18-24" deep perimeter thickened edge

**Q: How long does gas station structural engineering take?**
A: Typical medium gas station: 6-8 weeks for design and construction documents. Large or complex facilities: 10-14 weeks. Add 10-16 weeks for City of Highland and State Fire Marshal permit process.

**Q: What's the structural engineering cost?**
A: Ranges from $8,000 for small stations to $35,000+ for large truck plazas. Typical 4-6 island station with convenience store: $12,000-$20,000 for complete structural engineering.

**Q: Do I need a geotechnical investigation?**
A: Highly recommended. Geotech report provides soil bearing capacity, groundwater depth, and recommendations for foundations and pavements. Critical for proper design, especially in Highland's varied terrain.

**Q: Can I use a pre-engineered canopy?**
A: Yes. Many fuel brands (Chevron, Shell, Exxon) offer proprietary pre-engineered canopy systems. However, you still need a California engineer to design site-specific foundations and verify the pre-engineered system meets California codes.

**Q: What's the biggest challenge in gas station structural design?**
A: Wind uplift on large canopies. Highland's wind climate creates significant uplift forces that can exceed canopy weight. Requires careful analysis and design of anchor bolts and foundations to resist uplift and overturning.
