## Why You Need a Load Bearing Wall Engineer in Coachella

**When Engineering is Required:**
- Removing walls between kitchen and living areas
- Creating open concept floor plans
- Widening doorways in load-bearing walls
- Installing pass-throughs or openings in structural walls
- Any modification to walls supporting roof or upper floors
