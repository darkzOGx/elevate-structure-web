## 🔄 AUTO-INVOKE SERP API (MANDATORY ENRICHMENT STEP)

**⚡ After generating the blog topic list, you MUST enrich it with SERP API keyword intelligence.**

### Workflow: Generate List → SERP Enrich → Write Blogs

```
USER REQUEST          GENERATE LIST         SERP ENRICH           WRITE BLOGS
"Generate 20    →    20 blog titles   →    Batch fetch PAA/   →  Generate with
 blog posts"         with keywords         PASF for all 20        real SERP data
```

### Step 1: Generate Blog Topic List FIRST

When user requests multiple blog posts (e.g., "generate 20 blog posts"):

1. **Create the full list** of blog titles following the HIGH-CONVERSION TARGETING FRAMEWORK
2. **Extract primary keyword** for each blog post
3. **Map each keyword to a topic** from `keyword-intelligence/data/active_topics.json`

**Example output after Step 1:**
```
| # | Blog Title | Primary Keyword | Topic |
|---|------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | ADU Structural Engineering in Irvine | ADU structural engineering Irvine | residential-structural-engineering |
| 2 | Soft Story Retrofit Requirements Santa Monica | soft story retrofit Santa Monica | seismic-engineering |
| 3 | Foundation Repair Engineer Newport Beach | foundation repair Newport Beach | foundation-engineering |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Step 2: Batch SERP API Enrichment

**After the list is generated**, run SERP API for ALL keywords:

```bash
# For each keyword in the list, fetch intelligence:
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "ADU structural engineering Irvine" --topic residential-structural-engineering --save
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "soft story retrofit Santa Monica" --topic seismic-engineering --save
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "foundation repair Newport Beach" --topic foundation-engineering --save
# ... continue for all keywords in the list
```

**Or batch by topic if multiple blogs share the same topic:**
```bash
python keyword-intelligence/scheduler.py --run-now --topic residential-structural-engineering
python keyword-intelligence/scheduler.py --run-now --topic seismic-engineering
```

### Step 3: Read Enrichment Data

For each blog post, read its intelligence file and extract:
- `people_also_ask` → Real questions for FAQ section
- `people_also_search_for` → Related keywords to weave into content
- `long_tail_keywords` → Ideas for H2/H3 headers
- `serp_features_present` → Which schema to prioritize (featured_snippet → answer capsule, local_pack → LocalBusiness schema)
- `query_fan_out_intents` → Content structure by intent (cost, process, requirements, etc.)

### Step 4: Generate Enriched Blog Posts

Now write each blog using the SERP-enriched data:

**Before SERP enrichment (generic):**
```
FAQ Section:
- What is ADU structural engineering?
- How much does it cost?
- Do I need a permit?
```

**After SERP enrichment (real PAA questions):**
```
FAQ Section (from actual Google PAA):
- Do I need a structural engineer for an ADU in California?
- How much does a structural engineer charge for ADU plans?
- What size ADU can I build without a permit in Irvine?
- Can I convert my garage to an ADU in Orange County?
- What is the timeline for ADU permit approval in Irvine?
```

### Quick Reference: Topic Mapping

| Blog Topic Contains | Topic ID |
|-----------------------|----------|
| ADU, accessory dwelling, granny flat, addition | `residential-structural-engineering` |
| new residential, custom home, one story addition, two story addition | `residential-structural-engineering` |
| apartment units, multi-family | `residential-structural-engineering` |
| commercial, tenant improvement, office, retail | `commercial-structural-engineering` |
| warehouse, parking structure | `commercial-structural-engineering` |
| seismic, retrofit, earthquake, soft story | `seismic-engineering` |
| foundation, repair, hillside foundation, underpinning | `foundation-engineering` |
| crawl space, raised foundation, retaining wall | `foundation-engineering` |
| structural inspection, foundation inspection | `foundation-engineering` |
| permit, red tag, unpermitted, as-built, permit engineering | `permit-compliance` |
| hillside, slope, canyon, cantilevered | `hillside-engineering` |
| deck, balcony, structural analysis | `structural-engineering` |
| garage conversion | `residential-structural-engineering` |
| emergency, fire damage, earthquake damage | `emergency-engineering` |

### Example: 5 Blog Post Batch

**User:** "Generate 5 blog posts for Orange County"

**Step 1 - Generate list:**
```
1. ADU Structural Engineering in Irvine (residential-structural-engineering)
2. Soft Story Retrofit in Anaheim (seismic-engineering)
3. Foundation Repair in Newport Beach (foundation-engineering)
4. Coastal Bluff Engineering in Laguna Beach (coastal-engineering)
5. Red Tag Removal in Santa Ana (permit-compliance)
```

**Step 2 - Batch SERP fetch:**
```bash
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "ADU structural engineering Irvine" --topic residential-structural-engineering --save
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "soft story retrofit Anaheim" --topic seismic-engineering --save
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "foundation repair Newport Beach" --topic foundation-engineering --save
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "coastal bluff engineering Laguna Beach" --topic coastal-engineering --save
python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "red tag removal Santa Ana" --topic permit-compliance --save
```

**Step 3 - Read each intelligence file and generate enriched blogs**

---

Generate high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts for AAA Engineering Design targeting Southern California cities with proper keyword integration, internal linking, and local SEO optimization.

---

## 🔀 MODE SELECTION

**DEFAULT: Enrichment Mode (20 refresh + 5 new) runs automatically unless user specifies otherwise.**

If user just says "generate blogs" or "run the skill" → use **Enrichment Mode** with default mix of **20 refreshes + 5 new posts = 25 total**.

Only ask about mode if the user explicitly requests a different workflow:

```
Available Modes (if user asks):

1. Enrichment Mode (DEFAULT) — 20 refresh + 5 new posts per run
   Analyze GSC data, triage into ENRICH/CREATE/CONSOLIDATE,
   refresh existing posts first, then create new content

2. Standard Generation — New posts only (no refreshes)
   (SERP enrich → High-Conversion Targeting → Scaled production)

3. Consolidation Audit — Detect cannibalization clusters where 2+ pages compete for
   the same queries, pick winners, recommend merges/redirects (no content generated)

4. CTR Rescue — Focus exclusively on high-impression/zero-CTR pages, rewrite
   titles/meta/content to maximize click-through (refresh only, no new pages)
```

- If **Enrichment (DEFAULT)** → skip to the **Enrichment Mode Pipeline** section. Default: 20 refresh + 5 new.
- If **Standard** → continue to the MANDATORY FRAMEWORK and Smart Mode below (existing flow, zero changes).
- If **Consolidation Audit** → run GSC analysis, detect cannibalization clusters, present report.
- If **CTR Rescue** → run GSC analysis for refresh-only queue (all refresh, 0 new).

---

## 🧪 ENRICHMENT MODE PIPELINE

**This section only runs when the user selects "Enrichment Mode" in the Mode Selection prompt above.**

### ⛔ REMOVED SERVICES FILTER (MANDATORY — ALL MODES)

**Before scoring, triaging, or refreshing ANY blog post, ALWAYS exclude posts for removed services.**

Posts for the following removed service categories must NEVER be refreshed, enriched, or created:

| Removed Service | Keyword Patterns to Exclude |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **MEP Engineering** | mep, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, plumbing engineering |
| **Civil Engineering** | civil engineer, civil-site, site development |
| **Stormwater** | stormwater, storm water, drainage plan |
| **Grading & Drainage** | grading-and-drainage, site drainage |
| **Septic** | septic design, septic system |
| **Coastal Engineering** | coastal bluff, coastal foundation, coastal home, coastal commission |
| **ADA Compliance** | ada compliance, ada engineering |
| **Insurance Coordination** | insurance coordination |
| **Expedited Permitting** | expedited permitting |

**Filter logic (apply at every stage):**
1. Skip any blog post with `noIndex: true` in `blog-data.ts`
2. Skip any GSC query matching removed service keyword patterns above
3. Skip any candidate whose target slug contains a removed service keyword
4. If a CREATE candidate targets a removed service → **discard it entirely**
5. If an ENRICH candidate matches a removed service post → **skip, do not refresh**

**Active services only (23 services):** structural-engineering, seismic-retrofitting, residential, commercial, adu-engineering, load-bearing-wall-removal, foundation-engineering, foundation-repair, foundation-inspection, structural-inspection, crawl-space-repair, raised-foundation-repair, one-story-addition-engineering, two-story-addition-engineering, new-residential-engineering, apartment-units-engineering, garage-conversion-engineering, permit-engineering, deck-balcony-structural-analysis, warehouse-engineering, parking-structure-engineering, retaining-wall-engineering, hillside-engineering

---

### Step 1: Pull GSC Performance Data

Execute the GSC performance report to get current query/page data:

```bash
node scripts/gsc-performance-report.js
```

This generates `gsc-performance-report.json` with:
- All queries with impressions, clicks, CTR, position
- Page-level performance data
- Keyword opportunities ranked by potential

### Step 2: Identify Refresh vs New Candidates

**Scoring formula for all candidates (new + refresh):**

```
final_score = (seo_opportunity_score × 0.50) + (ctr_rescue_score × 0.30) + (strategic_fit_score × 0.20)
```

| Factor | Formula | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `seo_opportunity_score` | `impressions × (1 - ctr) × position_weight` | Raw search opportunity from GSC |
| `ctr_rescue_score` | `impressions × multiplier × (1 - ctr)` | Prioritizes high-impression/zero-CTR pages |
| `strategic_fit_score` | `archetype_match + service_priority + geo_tier` | Business impact and market fit |

**CTR rescue multiplier:**
- 2.0x if impressions ≥100 AND ctr=0 (urgent rescue)
- 1.5x if ctr <0.5% (high priority rescue)
- 1.0x otherwise (standard)

**Position weight lookup:**
- Position 1-3: 0.5 (already ranking well, low marginal gain)
- Position 4-10: 1.5 (page 1 with CTR upside — highest value)
- Position 11-20: 1.2 (page 2, within striking distance)
- Position 21+: 0.8 (too far to move with content alone)

### Step 3: Triage Opportunities

For each opportunity from GSC data, classify into one of three actions:

| Action | Trigger | What Happens |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **ENRICH** (refresh) | Query already covered by an existing blog post (slug match, title overlap, or Jaccard similarity ≥0.5 on keywords) | Rewrite title/meta/content of existing post in `blog-data.ts` |
| **CREATE** (new) | Genuine gap — no existing post competes for this query cluster | Create new blog post entry in `blog-data.ts` |
| **CONSOLIDATE** | 2+ existing posts compete for the same cluster with all CTRs <1% | Merge loser posts into winner, set losers to `noIndex: true` |

**Cannibalization detection (auto-convert to refresh):**
- Check A: Exact slug match against existing blog posts
- Check B: GSC shows multiple pages ranking for same query
- Check C: Jaccard token similarity ≥0.5 between candidate keyword and existing post keywords
- If cannibalization detected → convert to ENRICH (refresh existing post, don't create new)

Present triage results to the user:
```
📊 Enrichment Triage — AAA Engineering Design
─────────────────────────────────────────
ENRICH (refresh existing): X posts
CREATE (new content):      Y posts
CONSOLIDATE:               Z clusters

| # | Action      | Query/Cluster                    | Target Post                  | Score |
|---|-------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | ENRICH      | foundation repair Newport Beach  | /blog/foundation-repair-...  | 85    |
| 2 | CREATE      | hillside engineering Malibu      | (new)                        | 72    |
| 3 | CONSOLIDATE | seismic retrofit Santa Monica    | /blog/winner → 2 losers      | --    |
```

Ask user to confirm the triage (default: accept all).

### Production Mix Constraints (Default: 25 Posts Per Run)

**Default split (enforced): 20 refresh + 5 new = 25 total posts per run.**

- Target `20 refresh / 5 new` per run (80% refresh / 20% new).
- If refresh candidates are insufficient, backfill with new content (never block production).
- User can override with specific numbers (e.g., "generate 10 blog posts" = 8 refresh + 2 new).

**Refresh Slots (20 posts):**

| Slots | Category | Selection Rule |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1-5 | **CTR Rescue (Refresh)** | Top 5 high-impression/zero-CTR pages (ctr_rescue_score driven) |
| 6-10 | **Service Authority (Refresh)** | Top 5 scored existing posts needing content expansion |
| 11-15 | **FAQ Enrichment (Refresh)** | Top 5 posts lacking FAQs or with outdated FAQ content |
| 16-18 | **Hub Strengthening (Refresh)** | Top 3 hub/pillar pages needing content refresh |
| 19-20 | **Freshness Signal (Refresh)** | 2 oldest posts (>90 days since lastUpdated) with active-service keywords |

**New Content Slots (5 posts):**

| Slots | Category | Selection Rule |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 21-22 | **Geo Expansion (New)** | Top 2 scored new city/service combinations |
| 23-24 | **Near-Me Coverage (New)** | Top 2 "near me" keyword gaps |
| 25 | **Exploration Wildcard (New)** | Highest-scoring remaining candidate (must pass cannibalization gate) |

**Scaling rule:** When user requests a specific number (e.g., "10 posts"), maintain 80/20 ratio:
- 10 posts = 8 refresh + 2 new
- 15 posts = 12 refresh + 3 new
- 25 posts = 20 refresh + 5 new (default)
- 30 posts = 24 refresh + 6 new

### Step 4: Execute Enrichments (Refreshes First)

For each ENRICH candidate:
1. **Read the existing blog post** from `src/lib/blog-data.ts` by matching the slug/id
2. **Rewrite title** using CTR formula: `[Service Type] + [City] + [Number/Benefit] + [Year]`
3. **Rewrite excerpt/meta** using: `[Problem]. [Solution with number]. [Social proof]. [CTA].`
4. **Add/verify Quick Answer** (≤29 words for voice search / AIO snippet)
5. **Expand/refresh content body:**
   - Add new sections matching top GSC queries (PAA coverage, code references, checklists)
   - Update statistics and code references to current year
   - Add 2-4 internal links to service pages in first 400 words
6. **Add/update FAQ section** with 3-5 fresh PAA questions from SERP API:
   ```bash
   python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "[primary-keyword] [city]" --paa-only --save
   ```
7. **Update dates:**
   - `lastUpdated`: set to current date
   - Keep original `date` (datePublished) unchanged
8. **Validate schema:** Article + FAQPage + Speakable markup in content

### Step 5: Execute New Page Creation

For each CREATE candidate (only genuine gaps, after cannibalization gate):
1. SERP keyword enrichment:
   ```bash
   python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "[query]" --topic "[Topic]" --save
   ```
2. Generate content using the HIGH-CONVERSION TARGETING FRAMEWORK and 2026 SEO template
3. Follow all existing Smart Mode generation steps (schema, interlinking, trust signals)
4. Add new entry to `src/lib/blog-data.ts`

### Step 6: Execute Consolidations

For each CONSOLIDATE cluster:
1. **Identify winner** — post with highest impressions × position_weight
2. **Merge unique content** from loser posts into winner
3. **Set losers to `noIndex: true`** in `blog-data.ts`
4. **Add redirect** in `next.config.ts` from loser slugs to winner slug
5. **Update internal links** across all blog posts pointing to losers → point to winner

### Step 7: Summary Report

After all actions are executed, print:

```
📊 Enrichment Mode Summary — AAA Engineering Design
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Combined Impression Potential: XX,XXX
Estimated Click Uplift: X,XXX/month (at target CTR)
Action Breakdown: XX% refresh / XX% new
```

### After Enrichment Mode

Once all actions are executed, continue with the standard post-generation workflow:
- Git commit & deploy (see POST-GENERATION section)
- SEO submission via `python seo_submit.py`

## 🚨 MANDATORY FRAMEWORK - NO EXCEPTIONS 🚨

**⛔ STOP! Before generating ANY blog post, you MUST follow the HIGH-CONVERSION TARGETING FRAMEWORK below.**

**This is NOT optional. This is NOT a suggestion. This is the ONLY way to generate blog posts.**

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **City Selection** | ONLY from Platinum/Gold/Growth tier lists below |
| **Keyword Selection** | MUST match city's archetype (Subterranean/Coastal/Compliance) |
| **Content Allocation** | 40% Platinum, 35% Gold, 25% Growth |
| **Generic Content** | ❌ PROHIBITED - No generic residential posts for random cities |
| **Old 103-City Rotation** | ❌ DEPRECATED - Do NOT use |

**If a blog post request doesn't specify high-conversion targeting, APPLY IT AUTOMATICALLY.**

---

## ⚠️ HIGH-CONVERSION TARGETING FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY DEFAULT)

**Effective: December 2025**

This skill uses an **archetype-based, tiered market strategy** for maximum conversion and appointment setting. The old 103-city equal rotation is DEPRECATED and must NOT be used.

### ⚡ THREE MARKET ARCHETYPES (Match Content to Buyer Psychology)

| Archetype | Markets | Buyer Psychology | Fee Potential |
|-----------|---------|------------------|---------------|
| **SUBTERRANEAN & VERTICAL** | Atherton, Palo Alto, Beverly Hills, Manhattan Beach | Extreme land constraints → build underground/up. Working with starchitects. | $25K-$150K+ |
| **COASTAL FORTIFICATION** | Malibu, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, La Jolla, Montecito | Defending $3M-$30M+ coastal properties. Complex permitting. Fire/erosion damage. | $20K-$100K+ |
| **RESILIENCE & COMPLIANCE** | Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Pasadena, Long Beach | MANDATORY retrofit deadlines. Legal/financial pressure. Time-sensitive. | $15K-$75K |

### 🏆 MARKET TIERS (Content Allocation)

| Tier | Markets | Content % | Why |
|------|---------|-----------|-----|
| **PLATINUM** | Atherton, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills, Santa Monica, Laguna Beach, Montecito | **40%** | $3M-$7M+ homes, highest fees, complex projects |
| **GOLD** | Manhattan Beach, Pacific Palisades, La Jolla, Del Mar, West Hollywood, Pasadena, Bel Air, Brentwood, Coronado | **35%** | High volume, active ordinances, specific hazards |
| **GROWTH** | Long Beach, San Diego, San Jose, Irvine, Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Calabasas, Glendale, Burbank | **25%** | ADU scaling, standard renovations, volume |

### 🎯 CONTENT GENERATION RULES

**Before generating ANY blog post:**

1. **Identify the city's TIER** (Platinum/Gold/Growth)
2. **Identify the city's ARCHETYPE** (Subterranean/Coastal/Compliance)
3. **Select keywords from matching archetype cluster** in `references/keyword-list.md`
4. **Use archetype-specific CTAs** from `references/HIGH-CONVERSION-TARGETING.md`
5. **Include archetype-specific engineering content** (not generic)

**Archetype-Matched Keywords (Examples):**

| Archetype | ✅ USE These Keywords | ❌ NEVER Use For This City |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Subterranean | basement engineering, deep foundation, shoring, underpinning, vertical addition | coastal bluff, soft-story retrofit |
| Coastal | bluff stabilization, Coastal Commission, fire damage, erosion, wave force | basement, deep excavation |
| Compliance | soft-story retrofit, mandatory ordinance, seismic retrofit deadline, penalty | subterranean, coastal bluff |

### 📍 PRIORITY TRIGGERS (Override Normal Rotation)

Check these FIRST before selecting cities:

1. **Active Compliance Deadline?** → Prioritize that city with compliance keywords
   - Santa Monica soft-story deadlines
   - West Hollywood mandatory retrofit
   - LA Ordinance 183893 compliance

2. **Recent Disaster?** → Prioritize affected Platinum/Gold cities
   - Fire season → Malibu, Pacific Palisades, Montecito
   - Post-earthquake → All Platinum coastal cities

3. **Content Gap in Platinum?** → Fill before generating Growth content

**See `references/HIGH-CONVERSION-TARGETING.md` for complete framework.**

## 📊 TWO-TRACK CONTENT STRATEGY

### Track 1: GSC-Driven Optimization (Existing Footprint)
- **Source**: Google Search Console performance data (queries, pages, impressions, clicks, CTR, position)
- **Goal**: Maximize ROI from content that already has search visibility
- **Actions**:
  - **CTR gaps**: Pages ranking positions 1-5 with CTR < 3% → rewrite titles/meta descriptions
  - **Striking distance**: Pages at positions 8-20 → strengthen content, add internal links
  - **Winner replication**: Top-performing pages → create similar content for adjacent cities/keywords
  - **Cannibalization fix**: Multiple pages competing for same query → consolidate or differentiate

### Track 2: Seed & Saturate (New Services with Zero Data)
- **Source**: The 16 keyword-targeted specialty services listed above
- **Goal**: Build search presence for services with no existing content
- **Rule: SERVICE PAGE FIRST**:
  1. Before creating blog clusters for any service, verify a `/services/[service-id]` page exists
  2. If the service page does NOT exist, do not create blog content for that service yet
  3. Blog posts link UP to their parent service page (commercial-intent hub)
  4. Service pages are the conversion-intent anchor; blogs are informational satellites

### Dynamic Allocation
- Default split: 60% Track 1 / 40% Track 2
- If GSC data reveals many striking-distance opportunities: shift to 80% Track 1 / 20% Track 2
- If GSC data shows few optimization opportunities: shift to 30% Track 1 / 70% Track 2
- Track 2 content should target services where the service page already exists

### Removed-Service Blocklist Filter
When processing GSC data or selecting keywords, automatically exclude queries containing:
`mep engineer`, `civil engineer`, `stormwater`, `septic`, `coastal bluff`, `coastal foundation`, `coastal engineer`, `ada compliance`, `insurance coordination`, `expedited permit`, `drainage engineer`, `grading plan`

These represent services no longer offered. Any impressions/clicks from these queries should be ignored in performance analysis and not used to generate new content.

accepted by all [City/Region] building departments.
```

#### 2. Experience Quantification
Use specific numbers:
- "20+ years of experience"
- "500+ completed projects"
- "Serving [City] since [year]"

#### 3. Satisfaction Guarantee (Risk Reversal)
For distressed clients especially:
```markdown
**Our Commitment**: If our initial assessment doesn't identify a viable
path forward for your [red tag/permit issue], the consultation is free.
```

#### 4. Response Time Commitment
```markdown
📞 Same-day consultations available | 48-hour quote turnaround
```

### Market Positioning Statement
**Position AAA as the "Goldilocks" solution:**

```markdown
### Why Choose AAA Engineering Design?

- ✅ **Personal PE involvement** - Licensed engineer on every project
```

---

## ⚔️ COMPETITOR DIFFERENTIATION ANGLES

**Use these positioning statements when relevant (never mention competitors by name in published content):**

### vs. Large Firms (Degenkolb, Simpson Gumpertz, etc.)
**Their weakness**: Too expensive, slow response, hand off to junior staff
**Our message**:
```markdown
Unlike large engineering firms where your project may be assigned to junior
staff, AAA Engineering provides direct access to licensed Professional
Engineers on every project. We specialize in residential and small commercial
work—the projects big firms deprioritize.
```

### vs. Alpha Structural (Repair-Focused Competitor)
**Their focus**: Repair and retrofit of damaged structures
**Our differentiation**: Design of new structures
```markdown
We design the new—engineering for additions, ADUs, custom homes, and
structural modifications. When your vision involves building something new,
AAA Engineering brings it to life with PE-stamped plans.
```

### vs. Design-Build Firms
**Their conflict**: Same company designs AND builds (no oversight)
**Our value**: Independent oversight
```markdown
**Independent Engineering Oversight**: Unlike design-build firms where the
same company both designs and constructs, AAA Engineering provides independent
structural analysis. This separation ensures your project is designed for
safety—not just cost savings.
```

### vs. Unlicensed "Designers"
**Their risk**: No PE stamp, permit rejection risk
**Our protection**:
```markdown
**Don't risk permit rejection.** Only California-licensed Professional
Engineers can stamp structural plans. Our PE-stamped plans are accepted by
all California building departments—guaranteed.
```

## ⛔ CRITICAL URL/SLUG RULE - READ FIRST

**NEVER duplicate the city name in blog post IDs/slugs!**

```
❌ WRONG: adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach-newport-beach
✅ CORRECT: adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach

❌ WRONG: foundation-repair-in-irvine-irvine
✅ CORRECT: foundation-repair-in-irvine
```

**The city should appear ONLY ONCE at the end of the slug after `-in-`**

This rule applies to:
- Blog post `id` field in blog-data.ts
- Markdown filenames
- All URL references

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:
- Blog posts for aaaengineeringdesign.com
- Engineering-related content (structural, residential, foundation, commercial)
- Geo-targeted content for California cities (especially Orange County, LA, San Diego)
- 5 daily blog posts targeting different SoCal cities
- Content with keyword optimization and interlinking strategy
- Local SEO optimized articles
- AI Overview (AIO) optimized content

## ⚠️ SMART MODE IS NOW DEFAULT

**When the user asks to "generate blogs" or "create blog posts", ALWAYS use Smart Mode automatically.**

Smart Mode ensures:
- Data-driven keyword selection (GSC + Bing Lead Gen Scores)
- Optimal keyword+city pairing for maximum conversions
- Automatic cluster prioritization
- High-intent "near me" keywords included

**You do NOT need the user to explicitly say "smart mode" - it's automatic.**

## Workflow: Generating Daily Blog Posts

**⚠️ PERMANENT PRIORITY RULE: Complete Underpacked Clusters First!**

**Before generating random posts, ALWAYS check Step 2.5 to see if ANY topic clusters need completion:**
- Check ALL hubs (current + future) in blog-data.ts clusterPages arrays
- Find the most underpacked cluster (lowest post count)
- Currently: **Hub 5 (Commercial & Industrial)** has 0 posts - needs 25 posts ⚠️ HIGHEST PRIORITY
- Next: **Hub 6 (Foundation Engineering)** has 0 posts - needs 25 posts
- Then: **Hub 3 (Specialized Services)** has 17 posts - needs 8+ more to reach 25
- Generate ALL N posts for underpacked cluster ONLY until it reaches 25+ posts
- This rule applies FOREVER to all clusters (including future hubs you create)
- Only resume random rotation when ALL clusters have 25+ posts

---

**IMPORTANT: Automatic +5 "Near Me" Posts**

When user requests N blog posts, **ALWAYS generate N + 5 total posts:**
- **N posts** = Requested topics (currently: ALL for Hub 5 Commercial & Industrial until packed)
- **+5 posts** = "Near Me" GEO-localized posts (automatic bonus, any cluster)

**Example:**
- User says: "Generate 10 blog posts"
- You generate: **15 posts** (10 for Hub 5 Commercial & Industrial + 5 "near me")

**"Near Me" posts target high-intent local searches:**
- Format: `[keyword] near me in [city]`
- Example: "Residential Structural Engineer Near Me in Newport Beach"
- Rotates through topics: residential engineer, structural engineer, foundation engineer, ADU engineer, seismic retrofit engineer, foundation repair engineer, garage conversion engineer, permit engineer, etc.

### 🚀 SMART MODE: Data-Driven Auto-Generation (DEFAULT)

**⚠️ SMART MODE IS NOW THE DEFAULT - Always use this workflow when generating blogs.**

When generating blog posts, the system automatically:

1. **Runs Opportunity Gap Analysis** (`node scripts/opportunity-gap-analyzer.js`)
   - Identifies keywords at positions 11-30 (quick wins)
   - Finds high-impression/low-CTR gaps to optimize
   - Locates cities with insufficient coverage
   - Checks cluster completion status

2. **Fetches Fresh GSC + Bing Data** (if > 7 days old)
   - Google Search Console keyword performance
   - Bing Webmaster Tools data
   - Combined lead generation scoring

3. **Auto-Selects Optimal Keyword+City Pairs**
   - Prioritizes Lead Gen Score 70+ keywords
   - Matches high-value keywords to high-value cities
   - Ensures underpacked clusters get filled first
   - Avoids duplicate keyword+city combinations

4. **Generates Optimized Batch**
   - N posts for highest-priority opportunities
   - +5 "near me" posts (always)
   - All posts include conversion CTAs
   - Schema markup auto-applied

**Smart Mode Output:**
```
🧠 SMART MODE ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📊 Data Sources:
   GSC: 150 keywords (updated 2 days ago)
   Bing: 87 keywords (updated 5 days ago)

```

**Smart Mode is used automatically for:**
- All blog generation requests
- Weekly blog batches
- Any request for "X blog posts"
- Default behavior - no need to specify

**Override Smart Mode only when user explicitly requests:**
- Specific keywords they want to target
- A specific event/season campaign
- A very specific content gap to fill manually
- User says "don't use smart mode" or "manual selection"

---

### Step 0: HIGH-CONVERSION TARGETING (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**🚨 BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE - Apply the High-Conversion Framework:**

**For a batch of N posts, allocate cities by tier:**

| Tier | Allocation | Cities to Use |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **PLATINUM (40%)** | 2 posts (of 5) | Atherton, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills, Santa Monica, Laguna Beach, Montecito |
| **GOLD (35%)** | 2 posts (of 5) | Manhattan Beach, Pacific Palisades, La Jolla, Del Mar, West Hollywood, Pasadena, Bel Air, Brentwood, Coronado |
| **GROWTH (25%)** | 1 post (of 5) | Long Beach, San Diego, Irvine, Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Calabasas, Glendale, Burbank |

**Then match keywords to city archetype:**

| City Archetype | Use These Keywords |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Subterranean** (Beverly Hills, Atherton, Palo Alto, Manhattan Beach, Bel Air) | basement engineering, deep foundation, shoring, underpinning, vertical addition, hillside excavation |
| **Coastal** (Malibu, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, La Jolla, Montecito, Del Mar, Coronado) | coastal bluff stabilization, Coastal Commission, fire damage, oceanfront foundation, wave force, erosion |
| **Compliance** (Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Pasadena, Long Beach, Glendale) | soft-story retrofit, mandatory seismic retrofit, ordinance compliance, apartment building retrofit |

**❌ WRONG:** Generic "ADU engineering" post for Beverly Hills (doesn't match Subterranean archetype)
**✅ RIGHT:** "Basement Structural Engineering" post for Beverly Hills (matches Subterranean archetype)

---

### Step 0.5: Check Blog Tracking

**⚠️ After selecting tier-appropriate cities, verify no duplicates:**

```bash
view BLOG-TRACKING.md
```

**This file tracks ALL keyword+city combinations already used. You MUST:**
1. ✅ Read BLOG-TRACKING.md to see which keyword+city pairs are already published
2. ✅ Verify your selected keyword+city combination is NOT already used
3. ✅ Choose cities from Platinum/Gold/Growth tiers ONLY
4. ✅ Update BLOG-TRACKING.md after generating new posts

**NEVER create duplicate keyword+city combinations!**

---

### Step 0.5: GSC Keyword Extraction (AUTOMATIC WEEKLY)

**🤖 AUTOMATIC: This runs automatically if last extraction was > 7 days ago**

This automated process provides **real-time, data-driven keyword intelligence** by combining:
1. **Google Search Console API** - Real performance data from YOUR website
2. **"People Also Search For" (PASF) Scraping** - Related keyword discovery
3. **Automated Keyword List Updates** - Fresh, high-performing keywords

**What the System Does Automatically:**

1. **Auto-checks** when GSC extraction last ran
2. **If > 7 days ago**: Automatically runs full GSC + PASF extraction before generating blogs
3. **If < 7 days ago**: Skips extraction and uses existing keywords
4. **Fetches GSC Performance Data** (last 30 days):
   - 📊 **Impressions** - How many times your pages appeared in search
   - 🖱️ **Clicks** - Actual clicks from search results
   - 📈 **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** - Percentage of impressions that clicked
   - 📍 **Average Position** - Your ranking for each keyword
5. **Scrapes "People Also Search For" (PASF)** from Google:
   - Takes each GSC query and searches Google
   - Extracts related searches Google shows
   - Finds hidden long-tail opportunities
   - (Implementation: lines 193-246 in gsc-keyword-extractor.js)
6. **Combines Data for Maximum Coverage**:
   - GSC queries = proven keywords already driving traffic
   - PASF = related keywords you should target
   - Result = comprehensive keyword strategy
7. **Automatically adds discovered keywords to `references/keyword-list.md`**
8. **Creates `gsc-extracted-keywords.json`** with full metrics for analysis

**When it runs automatically:**
- ✅ **First time**: Never run before
- ✅ **Weekly refresh**: Last run was 7+ days ago
- ✅ **After errors**: Last run file is missing or corrupted
- ❌ **Skip**: Last run was less than 7 days ago

**What you'll see:**

If GSC extraction runs automatically:
```
🔍 Checking GSC extraction status...
⏰ Last run was 8 days ago (threshold: 7 days)
🚀 Running GSC extraction automatically...

📊 Connecting to Google Search Console...
✅ Connected to GSC
📥 Fetching queries from last 30 days...
✅ Found 150 queries
...
✅ Added 23 new keywords to keyword list
```

If GSC extraction is skipped:
```
🔍 Checking GSC extraction status...
✅ Last run was 3 days ago (threshold: 7 days)
⏭️  Skipping GSC extraction - using existing keywords
```

**Manual run (optional):**

You can still manually run GSC extraction anytime:

```bash
# Manual run (ignores last-run check)
node scripts/gsc-keyword-extractor.js

# Weekly run with custom parameters
GSC_DAYS_BACK=7 MAX_QUERIES=30 node scripts/gsc-keyword-extractor.js
```

**Configuration:**

Customize the auto-run threshold in `.env`:
```bash
# Run GSC extraction if last run was > X days ago (default: 7)
GSC_AUTO_RUN_DAYS=7
```

**Configuration options (via environment variables):**
- `GSC_PROPERTY_URL` - Your website URL (default: https://aaaengineeringdesign.com)
- `GSC_DAYS_BACK` - Days of data to fetch (default: 30)
- `MIN_IMPRESSIONS` - Minimum impressions to include keyword (default: 10)
- `MAX_QUERIES` - Maximum queries to process (default: 50)
- `GSC_CREDENTIALS_PATH` - Path to GSC credentials JSON (default: ./gsc-credentials.json)
- `SERPAPI_KEY` - SerpAPI key for "People Also Search For" extraction (optional)

**Output Files Created:**

1. **`references/keyword-list.md`** - Updated with new keywords
   - Automatically categorized by topic
   - Includes GSC performance notes
   - Ready to use in blog generation

2. **`gsc-extracted-keywords.json`** - Full analysis data
   ```json
   {
     "query": "residential structural engineer orange county",
     "impressions": 1450,
     "clicks": 87,
     "ctr": 0.06,
     "position": 8.5,
     "pasf_keywords": [
       "structural engineer cost orange county",
       "when to hire structural engineer",
       "residential structural engineer near me"
     ],
     "category": "residential-engineering",
     "search_intent": "local-service"
   }
   ```

**Example: How GSC + PASF Data Improves Blog Selection:**

**Without GSC (Old Way):**
- Guess which keywords might work
- No data on what's already performing
- Miss related keyword opportunities

**With GSC + PASF (New Way):**
```
📊 GSC Data Shows:
"residential structural engineer orange county"
- Impressions: 1,450
- Clicks: 87
- Position: 8.5
- CTR: 6%

💡 Insight: High impressions but position 8.5 = opportunity!
🎯 Action: Create targeted blog post to rank higher

🔍 PASF Discovers Related Keywords:
- "structural engineer cost orange county" (high commercial intent)
- "when to hire structural engineer" (informational, easy to rank)
- "residential structural engineer near me" (local intent)

✅ Result: Create 4 blog posts instead of 1, covering entire topic cluster!
```

**Setup requirements (one-time):**
1. Create Google Cloud project and enable Search Console API
2. Download service account credentials JSON
3. Save as `gsc-credentials.json` in project root
4. (Optional) Get SerpAPI key for enhanced "People Also Search For" extraction

See `scripts/GSC-SETUP-GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions.

**After GSC Extraction - How to Use the Data:**

1. **Prioritize High-Opportunity Keywords:**
   - High impressions + low CTR = need better content to capture clicks
   - High impressions + position 5-15 = can rank #1 with targeted content
   - PASF keywords = expand topic coverage

2. **Review `gsc-extracted-keywords.json` for insights:**
   ```bash
   # See top performing keywords
   cat gsc-extracted-keywords.json | jq '.[] | select(.impressions > 500)'

   # Find high-impression, low-CTR opportunities
   cat gsc-extracted-keywords.json | jq '.[] | select(.impressions > 100 and .ctr < 0.05)'
   ```

3. **Check `references/keyword-list.md` for newly added keywords:**
   - Look for keywords marked with GSC metrics
   - These are proven to drive traffic already

4. **Use in Next Blog Batch:**
   - Prioritize GSC keywords with high impressions
   - Include PASF keywords to create topic clusters
   - Target keywords in positions 5-15 (easiest to improve)

**Keyword Selection Strategy:**
- **Week 1**: GSC keywords with >500 impressions, position 5-15
- **Week 2**: PASF keywords related to your best performers
- **Week 3**: Low-competition long-tail from PASF
- **Week 4**: High-impression, low-CTR (improve existing rankings)

---

### Step 1: Auto-Check & Run GSC Extraction (If Needed)

**AUTOMATIC - Check if GSC extraction should run:**

Before reading references, automatically check if GSC extraction is needed:

1. **Check last run status** by running:
   ```bash
   node -e "const gsc = require('./scripts/gsc-keyword-extractor.js'); const status = gsc.shouldRunGSCExtraction(); console.log(status.shouldRun ? '⏰ GSC extraction needed: ' + status.reason : '✅ GSC is fresh: ' + status.reason);"
   ```

2. **If GSC extraction is needed** (last run > 7 days ago):
   ```bash
   echo "🚀 Running GSC extraction automatically..."
   node scripts/gsc-keyword-extractor.js
   ```

3. **If GSC is fresh** (last run < 7 days ago):
   ```bash
   echo "⏭️  Skipping GSC extraction - using existing keywords"
   ```

**This ensures keyword-list.md always has fresh, high-performing keywords!**

### Step 2: Read Required References

**CRITICAL - Always read these files AFTER GSC check:**

```bash
view references/keyword-list.md
view references/city-data.md
view references/near-me-keywords.md  # NEW: For automatic +5 "near me" posts
view references/blog-template.md
view references/interlinking-strategy.md
```

These files contain:
- All available keywords with intent and priority
- Complete city data (demographics, building codes, permit info)
- **"Near me" keyword rotation for automatic +3 bonus posts**
- Exact blog post structure matching aaaengineeringdesign.com format
- Internal linking rules and anchor text strategy

### Step 2.5: ⚠️ PRIORITY: Check Cluster Completion Status (DYNAMIC RULE)

**🎯 CRITICAL: Complete underpacked clusters BEFORE generating random posts!**

This is a **PERMANENT RULE** that applies to ALL topic clusters (current + future). This step ensures every hub reaches minimum post count before spreading content thin across multiple topics.

**Cluster Completion Thresholds:**
- **Minimum**: 20 posts (adequate for hub page)
- **Ideal**: 25+ posts (well-packed, strong topical authority)

**How This Rule Works:**

1. **ALWAYS check src/lib/blog-data.ts** - Count posts in EVERY hub's `clusterPages` array
2. **Find the most underpacked cluster** (lowest post count)
3. **Priority order:**
   - If ANY cluster has < 20 posts → Generate ALL N posts for that cluster ONLY
   - If multiple clusters < 20 posts → Pick the one with FEWEST posts first
   - If all clusters have 20+ posts but some < 25 → Fill to 25 before rotating
   - If ALL clusters have 25+ posts → Resume normal rotation across all clusters

**Current Cluster Status (As of 2025-11-17):**

```typescript
// Hub 1: Structural Engineering Services Guide
topicCluster: 'structural-engineering'
Current: 25 posts ✅ ADEQUATE

// Hub 2: Engineering Design Services Guide
topicCluster: 'engineering-design'
Current: 32 posts ✅ WELL-PACKED

// Hub 3: Specialized Engineering Services Guide
topicCluster: 'specialized-services'
Current: 17 posts ⚠️ UNDERPACKED (needs 8+ more posts to reach 25)

// Hub 4: Residential Structural Engineering Guide
topicCluster: 'residential-engineering'
Current: 28 posts ✅ WELL-PACKED

// Hub 5: Commercial & Industrial Structural Engineering Guide 🆕 NEW
topicCluster: 'commercial-industrial-engineering'
Current: 0 posts ❌ EMPTY (needs 25+ posts) ⚠️⚠️ HIGHEST PRIORITY

// Hub 6: Foundation Engineering Guide 🆕 NEW
topicCluster: 'foundation-engineering'
Current: 0 posts ❌ EMPTY (needs 25+ posts)
```

**Action Required:**

1. **Check ALL hubs in src/lib/blog-data.ts** (including any new ones created since this was written)
2. **Identify the most underpacked cluster** (< 20 posts, or lowest count if multiple)
3. **If ANY cluster is underpacked:**
   - Generate ALL N posts for that cluster ONLY
   - Still add +5 "near me" posts (can be any cluster)
   - Focus keyword selection on topics that fit the underpacked cluster
4. **If ALL clusters are 20+ posts:**
   - Fill clusters with < 25 posts to reach 25 (pick lowest first)
5. **ONLY if ALL clusters have 25+ posts:**
   - Resume normal keyword rotation across all clusters
   - You can still keep this Step 2.5 as a check, or remove it

**Example - Current Priority:**

Since **Hub 5 (Commercial & Industrial)** has **0 posts** (lowest of all hubs), generate posts ONLY for this cluster until it reaches 25+ posts:

**Keywords to prioritize for Hub 5:**
- Commercial structural engineering topics
- Office building structural engineering
- Warehouse structural engineering
- Retail center structural design
- Industrial facility engineering
- Manufacturing plant structural design
- Tenant improvement engineering
- Commercial building codes
- Mixed-use development structural engineering
- Parking structure design
- Commercial foundation design
- Tilt-up construction engineering

**Next priority after Hub 5 reaches 25 posts:**
- **Hub 6 (Foundation Engineering)** - 0 posts (foundation types, repair methods, expansive soils, etc.)
- **Hub 3 (Specialized Services)** - 17 posts (inspection, permit engineering, deck/balcony, garage conversion topics)

**Important: This Rule Applies to Future Hubs Too!**

When you create new hub pages (e.g., Commercial Engineering, Foundation Engineering, ADU Engineering), they will start with 0 cluster posts. This rule ensures you'll prioritize filling those NEW hubs to 25 posts before going back to random rotation.

**Example Scenario:**
- Today: Hub 3 has 17 posts → Fill to 25 → Done
- Next week: Create new "Commercial Engineering" hub with 0 posts
- Rule activates again: New hub has 0 posts → Fill to 25 first
- Rule applies FOREVER until user explicitly decides all clusters are done

**When to remove this rule:**
- Only remove if you want to allow sparse clusters going forward
- Keep this rule active to maintain high topical authority
- Recommended: Keep this as a permanent check in the workflow

---

### Step 3: Select Keywords and Cities

**Total Posts to Generate: N + 5**
- **N posts** = User's requested number (e.g., 5, 10, etc.)
- **+5 posts** = Automatic "near me" posts (ALWAYS added)

**Regular Keyword Selection (N posts):**
1. **⚠️ FIRST: Check Step 2.5 - If cluster completion is required, select keywords for underpacked cluster ONLY**
2. Choose N keywords from `references/keyword-list.md`
3. Mix keyword types:
   - 1-2 Cluster articles (commercial/transactional intent)
   - 2-3 PAA/Informational articles
   - Occasionally include 1 Pillar article
4. Prioritize keywords marked as 🎯 High Priority
5. **CHECK BLOG-TRACKING.md** - Avoid keywords already used with target cities

**"Near Me" Keyword Selection (+5 posts):**
1. Use next 5 keywords in rotation from `references/near-me-keywords.md`
2. Check BLOG-TRACKING.md for last "near me" keyword used
3. Resume rotation from next keyword
4. These are HIGH commercial intent (ready to hire)

**City Selection:**
1. **CHECK BLOG-TRACKING.md FIRST** - Use only available cities
2. Use rotation pattern from `references/city-data.md`
3. Day 1: Long Beach, Irvine, Newport Beach, Anaheim, Santa Ana
4. Day 2: Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Mission Viejo, Laguna Beach
5. Day 3: San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Tustin, Garden Grove
6. Day 4-5: Continue rotation through all 25 cities
7. Mix coastal and inland cities
8. Vary property values (luxury, mid-range, affordable)
9. **VERIFY: Each keyword+city pair is unique (not in BLOG-TRACKING.md)**

**Pairing Strategy:**
- Match keyword intent with appropriate city
- Commercial keywords → Higher-value cities (Newport Beach, Irvine)
- Informational keywords → Any city
- Transactional keywords → Major metro areas (LA, Long Beach, San Diego)

### Step 4: Topic Cluster Integration (CRITICAL FOR SEO)

**🎯 All blog posts must be assigned to a topic cluster for maximum topical authority**

#### What Are Topic Clusters?

Topic clusters are groups of related content organized around a central "hub" page:
- **Hub Page**: Comprehensive 3,250-4,000 word guide on a broad topic
- **Cluster Pages**: Focused 3,250-4,000 word articles on specific subtopics
- **Bidirectional Links**: All clusters link to hub, hub links to all clusters

This structure signals to Google that we are THE authority on the topic.

#### Current Hub Pages

Refer to `.claude/skills/socal-engineering-blog/CLUSTER-MAPPING.md` for the complete cluster structure.

#### How to Assign Posts to Clusters

**For Each New Blog Post:**

1. **Determine Hub Assignment** based on primary keyword:

| Primary Keyword Contains... | Assign to Hub | Hub ID |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------|
| "structural engineer", "seismic", "foundation", "ADU", "home addition" | Structural Engineering | `structural-engineering-services-guide` |
| "engineering design", "design services", "sustainable design", "custom design" | Engineering Design | `engineering-design-services-guide` (planned) |
| "structural inspection", "foundation inspection", "permit engineering", "deck", "balcony", "garage conversion", "retaining wall" | Specialized Services | `specialized-engineering-services-guide` (planned) |
| "Title 24", "building code", "license", "compliance" | Building Compliance | `building-codes-compliance-guide` (planned) |
| "commercial building", "tenant improvement", "commercial engineering" | Commercial Services | `commercial-engineering-services-guide` (planned) |

2. **Add Cluster Metadata Fields** to the BlogPost object:

```typescript
{
  id: 'your-post-id',
  title: 'Your Post Title',
  excerpt: '...',
  category: 'Structural Engineering',
  date: '2025-11-17',
  readTime: '12 min read',
  author: 'AAA Engineering Team',
  image: 'https://...',
  featured: false,
  relatedArticles: ['related-post-1', 'related-post-2', 'hub-page-id'],  // ← ADD HUB TO RELATED ARTICLES

  // Topic Cluster Metadata (REQUIRED for all new posts)
  contentType: 'cluster',  // or 'hub' for hub pages, 'supporting' for general posts
  hubPage: 'structural-engineering-services-guide',  // ID of parent hub
  topicCluster: 'structural-engineering',  // Cluster name
  primaryKeyword: 'adu structural engineering',  // Main keyword for this post
  secondaryKeywords: ['accessory dwelling unit', 'adu design'],  // 2-3 related keywords
  geoTarget: 'Los Alamitos',  // City/region targeted

  content: `...`
}
```

3. **Add Hub Reference in Content** (in first 500 words):

```markdown
This article is part of our comprehensive [Structural Engineering Services Guide](/blog/structural-engineering-services-guide), which covers everything you need to know about structural engineering in Southern California.
```

OR integrate naturally:

```markdown

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Blog Post ID Format & Linking Rules

**MUST READ BEFORE CREATING HUB PAGES OR LINKING TO BLOG POSTS**

#### Blog Post ID Pattern

**🆕 NEW FORMAT (For All New Blog Posts - Use This!):**

Generate IDs using this clean pattern:
```typescript
// Format: {keyword-phrase}-in-{city}
'adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach'
'structural-engineering-for-home-additions-in-brea'
'seismic-retrofit-requirements-in-cypress'
'commercial-building-engineering-in-irvine'
```

**ID Generation Rules:**
1. Take the primary keyword phrase
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace spaces with hyphens
4. Add `-in-` separator
5. Add city name (kebab-case) **⚠️ SINGLE OCCURRENCE ONLY - NEVER DUPLICATE THE CITY**
6. Use kebab-case throughout (all lowercase, hyphens only)

**⛔ STOP AND VERIFY: Does your ID end with the city name appearing TWICE?**
```
❌ BAD: deep-foundation-design-in-poway-poway     (poway appears twice!)
✅ GOOD: deep-foundation-design-in-poway          (poway appears once)
```

**Examples:**
- Keyword: "ADU Structural Engineering" + City: "Newport Beach"
  → ID: `adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach`

- Keyword: "Commercial Building Engineering" + City: "Irvine"
  → ID: `commercial-building-engineering-in-irvine`

- Keyword: "Seismic Retrofit Requirements" + City: "Cypress"
  → ID: `seismic-retrofit-requirements-in-cypress`

**Non-geo Posts (no city):**
```typescript
'structural-engineering-services-guide'  // Hub pages
'building-code-compliance-2024'  // Year-based
'structural-engineer-requirements'  // Generic topics
```

---

**⚠️ LEGACY FORMAT (Existing Posts Only - DO NOT USE for new posts):**

Most existing blog posts (106 total) use an OLD pattern with city duplication:
```typescript
'adu-structural-engineering-in-los-alamitos-los-alamitos'  // City appears TWICE
'structural-engineering-for-home-additions-in-brea-brea'  // City appears TWICE
'seismic-retrofit-requirements-in-cypress-cypress'  // City appears TWICE
```

**Why the duplication exists:** Legacy automated generation created this pattern. We're NOT changing existing posts (would break external links), but NEW posts should use the clean format above.

**When linking to existing posts:** Use the full duplicated ID as it appears in blog-data.ts

#### How to Find Correct Blog Post IDs

**BEFORE creating hub page links, run this command:**

```bash
# Get all blog post IDs sorted alphabetically
grep -o "id: '[^']*'" src/lib/blog-data.ts | sed "s/id: '//" | sed "s/'//" | sort -u
```

**Or search for specific topics:**

```bash
# Find all ADU-related post IDs
grep -o "id: '[^']*'" src/lib/blog-data.ts | sed "s/id: '//" | sed "s/'//" | grep adu

# Find all seismic-related post IDs
grep -o "id: '[^']*'" src/lib/blog-data.ts | sed "s/id: '//" | sed "s/'//" | grep -E "seismic|earthquake|retrofit"

# Find all posts for a specific city
grep -o "id: '[^']*'" src/lib/blog-data.ts | sed "s/id: '//" | sed "s/'//" | grep "newport-beach"
```

#### Hub Page Content Format (RichBlogContent Component)

Hub page content is parsed by the `RichBlogContent` component which supports:

**✅ Supported Markdown:**

```markdown
## Main Heading (H2)
Creates a gradient card with large heading

### Sub Heading (H3)
Creates a styled H3 with decorative line

### Sub Heading with Bullet Points
- [Link Text](/blog/actual-post-id)
- [Another Link](/blog/another-actual-post-id)

**Bold Statement**
Creates a highlighted card with icon

Regular paragraph text with [inline links](/blog/post-id).

Important: This is a callout box
Note: Another callout style
Tip: A helpful tip box
Pro Tip: Expert advice box
```

**❌ Common Errors:**

1. **Wrong: Using shortened IDs**
   ```markdown
   - [ADU Engineering](/blog/adu-structural-engineering-newport-beach)
   ```
   Should be:
   ```markdown
   - [ADU Engineering](/blog/adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach-newport-beach)
   ```

2. **Wrong: Forgetting `/blog/` prefix**
   ```markdown
   - [Link](adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach-newport-beach)
   ```
   Should be:
   ```markdown
   - [Link](/blog/adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach-newport-beach)
   ```

3. **Wrong: Using markdown in clusterPages array**
   ```typescript
   clusterPages: [
     '[ADU Engineering](/blog/adu-post)'  // ❌ NO! Just IDs!
   ]
   ```
   Should be:
   ```typescript
   clusterPages: [
     'adu-structural-engineering-in-newport-beach-newport-beach'  // ✅ Just the ID
   ]
   ```

#### Verification Checklist Before Committing Hub Page

**Run these checks:**

```bash
# 1. Extract all blog post IDs from your hub content
grep -o '/blog/[^)]*' src/lib/blog-data.ts | grep "your-hub-id" -A 200 | sed 's|/blog/||' | sort -u > hub-links.txt

# 2. Get all actual blog post IDs
grep -o "id: '[^']*'" src/lib/blog-data.ts | sed "s/id: '//" | sed "s/'//" | sort -u > actual-ids.txt

# 3. Find broken links (IDs in hub that don't exist)
comm -23 hub-links.txt actual-ids.txt

# If this outputs anything, those are BROKEN LINKS - fix them!
```

**✅ All hub links verified = No 404 errors**

---

### 🔧 RichBlogContent Component (How Hub Content is Rendered)

**Location:** `src/components/RichBlogContent.tsx`

This component parses hub page content and converts markdown to rich HTML. Understanding how it works is critical for proper formatting.

#### How Content is Parsed

**1. Content is split by double newlines (`\n\n`)**

```typescript
const sections = content.split('\n\n')
```

Each section between blank lines is processed independently.

**2. Processing Order (IMPORTANT - First match wins!)**

The component checks each section in this order:
1. ✅ Main headings (`## `)
2. ✅ Sub-headings with bullet points (`### ` + `\n-`)
3. ✅ Sub-headings alone (`### `)
4. ✅ Bold text (`**text**`)
5. ✅ Bullet point lists (`\n-`)
6. ✅ Callout boxes (`Important:`, `Note:`, `Tip:`)
7. ✅ Regular paragraphs

**3. Markdown Link Parsing**

Links are converted using regex:
```typescript
const withLinks = text.replace(/\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g,
  '<a href="$2" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">$1</a>')
```

#### ✅ FIXED: Sub-headings with Bullet Points

**Previously (BUG - caused raw markdown to show):**
```typescript
// Old code only extracted heading text, ignoring bullet points
if (section.startsWith('### ')) {
  const title = section.replace('### ', '').trim()  // Got ENTIRE section as title!
  return <h3>{title}</h3>  // Rendered bullets as plain text in heading
}
```

**Now (FIXED - properly handles headings + bullets):**
```typescript
// New code checks for bullet points after heading
if (section.startsWith('### ')) {
  if (section.includes('\n-')) {
    // Extract heading from first line only
    const lines = section.split('\n')
    const heading = lines[0].replace('### ', '').trim()
    const items = lines.slice(1).filter(line => line.trim().startsWith('-'))

    // Render heading + parsed bullet list with clickable links
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>{heading}</h3>
        <ul>
          {items.map(item => {
            const withLinks = item.replace(/\[...\]\(...\)/g, '<a...>')
            return <li dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: withLinks }} />
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

**This fix resolved 114 broken links across 3 hub pages!**

#### Best Practices for Hub Content

**✅ DO:**
```markdown
## Related Resources

### Residential Services
- [When to Hire](/blog/when-to-hire-residential-structural-engineer-mission-viejo)
- [What Engineers Do](/blog/what-do-structural-engineers-do-costa-mesa)

### Commercial Services
- [Commercial Engineering](/blog/commercial-building-engineering-design-california-anaheim)
- [Tenant Improvements](/blog/commercial-tenant-improvement-engineering-in-murrieta-murrieta)
```

**❌ DON'T:**
```markdown
## Related Resources

### Residential Services
[When to Hire](/blog/...), [What Engineers Do](/blog/...)  // ❌ Comma-separated on same line

### Commercial Services - [Commercial Engineering](/blog/...) - [Tenant Improvements](/blog/...)  // ❌ Links in heading
```

**Why?** The component expects:
- Headings on their own line
- Bullet points on separate lines
- One link per bullet point (or space-separated is ok)

---

#### Internal Linking Rules for Clusters

**Every Cluster Post Must:**
- ✅ Link to parent hub page (in content + relatedArticles)
- ✅ Link to 2-3 sibling clusters (related topics in same hub)
- ✅ Link to 2-3 service pages
- ✅ Include hub reference in first 500 words

**Hub Pages Must:**
- ✅ Link to ALL cluster posts (18-25 links)
- ✅ Group clusters by subtopic
- ✅ Include contextual anchor text for each cluster link
- ✅ Feature comprehensive FAQ section (8-10 questions)

#### Example: Cluster Post Template

✅ **Internal Link Flow**: PageRank flows from hub to clusters and back
✅ **User Experience**: Visitors find related content easily
✅ **Content Organization**: Clear structure makes content management easier

### Step 5: Generate Each Blog Post

For each of the 5 posts, follow this process:

**A. Generate Blog Post ID**

**CRITICAL - Use the NEW clean ID format (no city duplication):**

```
ID Format: {keyword-phrase}-in-{city-name}
```

**Example:**
- Keyword: "Commercial Building Engineering"
- City: "Newport Beach"
- ID: `commercial-building-engineering-in-newport-beach`

**Steps:**
1. Take primary keyword phrase
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace spaces with hyphens
4. Replace special characters with hyphens (e.g., "&" → "and")
5. Add `-in-` separator
6. Add city name (kebab-case) - **single occurrence, NO duplication**
7. **Verify uniqueness** - check blog-data.ts to ensure ID doesn't already exist

**Verification Command:**
```bash
grep "id: 'your-generated-id'" src/lib/blog-data.ts
# Should return nothing if ID is unique
```

**B. Create Post Structure**

Use the EXACT structure from `references/blog-template.md`:

1. Header Metadata
2. Opening paragraph with regional context
3. What is [Topic]? section
4. Core Services/Types section
5. Geographic Considerations (heavy city mentions)
6. Cost section (regional pricing)
7. Selection criteria section
8. Common challenges section
9. Why Choose AAA section
10. Contact section
11. CTA box
12. Related Articles (3 posts)

**B. Write Content Following These Rules:**

**Geographic Integration (CRITICAL):**
- Primary City: 15-20 mentions throughout post
- Secondary Cities: 5-8 mentions total
- Use city-specific data from `references/city-data.md`
- Include local regulations, permit times, market data

**Keyword Optimization:**
- Primary keyword in: Title, H1, first paragraph, one H2, conclusion, URL
- Keyword density: 1-1.5% (natural, not stuffed)
- Optimize for featured snippets (direct answers early)

**Internal Linking (from `references/interlinking-strategy.md`):**
- 5-8 internal links total per post
- 2-3 service page links
- 2-4 blog post links (related topics)
- Use keyword-rich anchor text
- First link within first 500 words

**External Linking:**
- 2-3 authority links (building dept, CBC, professional orgs)
- Open in new tabs

**C. Add Schema Markup (REQUIRED - All Schemas Combined)**

**CRITICAL FOR RICH SNIPPETS & LOCAL PACK:** Every blog post MUST include comprehensive schema markup. Use the combined schema template from `assets/schema-templates/combined-blog-schema.json`.

### Schema Priority Levels

| Priority | Schema | Template File | Rich Snippet Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **HIGH** | Organization | `organization-schema.json` | Knowledge Panel, brand identity, E-E-A-T |
| **HIGH** | LocalBusiness | `local-business-schema.json` | Local Pack, Maps, "near me" searches |
| **HIGH** | Service | `service-schema.json` | Service listings, availability, pricing |
| **HIGH** | FAQ | `faq-schema.json` | FAQ dropdowns, PAA boxes, expanded footprint |
| **MEDIUM** | Breadcrumb | `breadcrumb-schema.json` | Site hierarchy in results |
| **MEDIUM** | Review/AggregateRating | `review-snippets-schema.json` | Star ratings, trust signals |
| **MEDIUM** | Article | `article-schema.json` | Article info, freshness signals |
| **LOWER** | HowTo | `howto-schema.json` | Step-by-step display (process posts only) |
| **LOWER** | Product | `product-schema.json` | Price range cards (service posts) |

### Combined Schema Implementation

**ALWAYS use the combined @graph format** from `assets/schema-templates/combined-blog-schema.json`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", "@id": ".../#organization", ... },
    { "@type": "LocalBusiness", "@id": ".../#localbusiness", "areaServed": {"@type": "City", "name": "{{CITY}}"}, ... },
    { "@type": "Service", "name": "{{SERVICE}} in {{CITY}}", "provider": {"@id": ".../#organization"}, ... },
    { "@type": "TechnicalArticle", "headline": "{{TITLE}}", "author": {"@id": ".../#organization"}, ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [...] },
    { "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [...] },
    { "@type": "Review", "itemReviewed": {"@id": ".../#organization"}, ... }
  ]
}
```

### Schema Field Requirements

**Organization (include in ALL posts):**

### Speakable Schema (Voice Search Optimization)

Include speakable schema for Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri optimization:

```json
{
  "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
  "cssSelector": [".answer-capsule", "h1", ".quick-answer", ".faq-answer"]
}
```

Add to your Article schema within the @graph array.

**Voice-Optimized Content Rules**:
- Question-format H2 headings (matches spoken queries)
- 40-60 word answers (optimal for voice reading)
- Conversational tone (sounds natural when read aloud)
- First-person pronouns in FAQs for relatability

---

## Answer Capsules (CRITICAL for 2025)

Every blog post MUST include an Answer Capsule at the top for AI Overview extraction:

```html
<aside class="answer-capsule" data-speakable="true">
  <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> {40-60 words, direct answer to H1 query,
  include 2-3 specific numbers/data points, conversational tone for voice}
</aside>
```

**Answer Capsule Requirements**:
- Exactly 40-60 words (voice assistant reading length)
- Directly answer the H1 question in first sentence
- Include 2-3 specific numbers or data points
- Use conversational language (sounds natural when read aloud)
- Mark with `data-speakable="true"` for Google Assistant/Alexa

**Example**:
> "A structural engineer in Beverly Hills typically costs $3,000-$15,000 for residential projects. For hillside homes, expect $5,000-$25,000 due to complex soils engineering. AAA Engineering Design offers free initial consultations with 48-hour turnaround on standard assessments."

---

## PAA/PASF Keyword Integration

Enhance every blog post with People Also Ask (PAA) and People Also Search For (PASF) keywords:

**PAA Questions** (Use in FAQ section):
- "How much does a structural engineer cost in [city]?"
- "Do I need a structural engineer for [project type]?"
- "What does a structural engineer do for [project]?"
- "How long does structural engineering take?"
- "Is a structural engineer required by [city] building code?"

**PASF Keywords** (Weave naturally into content):
- "[city] structural engineer reviews"
- "affordable structural engineer near me"
- "residential structural engineer [city]"
- "best structural engineer [county]"
- "[project type] engineer [city]"

**Keyword Research Process**:
1. Search primary keyword on Google
2. Extract PAA questions from search results
3. Extract "Related searches" / PASF at bottom
4. Include 5-8 PAA questions in FAQ section
5. Weave 5-10 PASF keywords throughout content

---

## Bing-Specific SEO Requirements

**Bing Algorithm Priorities** (Different from Google):

1. **Exact-match keywords** - Bing weights exact keyword matches more heavily than Google
2. **Meta keywords tag** - Bing still reads and values the meta keywords tag (Google ignores it)
3. **Social signals** - Include shareable elements and social proof
4. **Multimedia richness** - Bing heavily rewards pages with images, videos, charts
5. **Clear topic focus** - One primary topic per page, no tangents
6. **Domain age signals** - Reference established presence, founding date, track record
7. **IndexNow integration** - Submit new URLs for instant Bing indexing

**Required Bing Meta Tags**:
```html
<meta name="keywords" content="structural engineer [city], [service] [city], [keyword] near me">
<meta name="msvalidate.01" content="{Bing Webmaster Tools verification}">
<meta name="bingbot" content="index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large">
```

**Bing-Optimized URL Structure**:
- Use exact-match keywords in slug
- Prefer hyphens over underscores
- Keep URLs under 75 characters
- Example: `/blog/structural-engineer-beverly-hills-residential`

**⚠️ MANDATORY SLUG VERIFICATION:**
Before proceeding, visually confirm EVERY blog post ID follows this pattern:
```
✅ keyword-phrase-in-city-name     (city appears ONCE)
❌ keyword-phrase-in-city-name-city-name  (city appears TWICE - FIX THIS!)
```

### Step 6.5: Featured Post Selection (AUTOMATIC)

**🌟 Featured Post Rule:**
- For every 5 new blog posts generated, mark 1 as `featured: true`
- **Maximum of 3 featured posts total** at any given time
- When adding new featured post and already at 3, remove `featured: true` from oldest featured post

**Calculation:**
- Generating 5 posts → 1 featured
- Generating 10 posts → 2 featured
- Generating 15 posts → 3 featured
- Generating 20 posts → 4 featured (but must remove 1 old featured to maintain max 3)

**Example Batch (10 posts):**
- Posts 1-4: `featured: false`
- **Post 5**: `featured: true` ← First featured
- Posts 6-9: `featured: false`
- **Post 10**: `featured: true` ← Second featured
- +5 "near me" posts: `featured: false` (never featured)

**Featured Post Selection Strategy:**
1. Choose posts with highest commercial intent keywords (hire, cost, find, best, top)
2. Prefer posts targeting high-value cities (Newport Beach, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego)
3. Ensure featured posts represent diverse topics (not all same keyword)
4. Prioritize posts that will rank well (low competition, high search volume)

**Maintaining 3-Post Maximum:**

Before adding new featured posts, check current count:
```bash
grep -c "featured: true" src/lib/blog-data.ts
```

If count will exceed 3:
1. Identify oldest featured posts (check dates)
2. Remove `featured: true` from oldest posts
3. Keep only the 3 most recent featured posts

**Important:** Hub pages are marked `featured: true` but don't count toward the 3-post limit (they're permanent featured content).

### Step 7: Output Format

Create 5 separate markdown files:
```
blog-posts-[DATE]/
├── 1-[keyword-slug]-[city-slug].md
├── 2-[keyword-slug]-[city-slug].md
├── 3-[keyword-slug]-[city-slug].md
├── 4-[keyword-slug]-[city-slug].md
└── 5-[keyword-slug]-[city-slug].md
```

Save files to project root directory in format: `blog-posts-nov-[day]-2025/`

### Step 8: Update Blog Tracking (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Update BLOG-TRACKING.md immediately after generating posts**

Add each new post to the tracking file:
```markdown
| [Keyword/Topic] | [City] | ✅ Published | [Date] |
```

Update the following sections in BLOG-TRACKING.md:
1. ✅ Add new keyword+city combinations to "Published Blog Posts" table
2. ✅ Update city usage counts in "Available Cities" section
3. ✅ Update "Keywords Already Used with Cities" section
4. ✅ Update "Recommended Next 5 City Selections" for future batches

### Step 9: Deploy to Website (CRITICAL - AUTOMATED EXECUTION)

**🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT NOTICE 🚨**

> **THIS PROJECT DEPLOYS TO NETLIFY - NOT VERCEL**
>
> The aaaengineeringdesign.com website is hosted on **Netlify**. There is NO Vercel project for this codebase.
>
> - ✅ Deployment trigger: `git push origin master` → Netlify auto-deploys
> - ❌ DO NOT attempt to deploy to Vercel
> - ❌ DO NOT run `vercel` CLI commands
> - ❌ DO NOT reference Vercel in deployment instructions
>
> Netlify deployment URL: Automatically built from master branch pushes

---

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Execute ALL deployment commands automatically after blog generation**

**The project includes `scripts/add-blog-posts.js` which automatically:**
1. **Auto-detects the most recent `blog-posts-*` directory** (or accepts path as argument)
2. Parses markdown files from that directory
3. Extracts frontmatter and content
4. Converts to TypeScript BlogPost objects
5. **Automatically sets first 3 posts as `featured: true`** (appears in Featured Articles)
6. **Uses date from frontmatter or today's date**
7. **CORRECTLY inserts posts into BLOG_POSTS array BEFORE helper functions**
8. Preserves all existing posts and structure

**Execute these commands in sequence:**

```bash
# 1. Run the conversion script (auto-detects most recent blog-posts directory)
node scripts/add-blog-posts.js

# 2. Verify build succeeds
npm run build

# 3. Commit changes with detailed commit message
git add src/lib/blog-data.ts blog-posts-nov-8-2025/ .claude/skills/socal-engineering-blog/BLOG-TRACKING.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Add [NUMBER] new SEO-optimized blog posts for [Month Day, Year]

- [Blog Post 1 Title]
- [Blog Post 2 Title]
- [Blog Post 3 Title]
[- Blog Post 4 Title if 4+ posts]
[- Blog Post 5 Title if 5 posts]

EOF
)"

# 4. Push to trigger Netlify deployment
git push origin master

# 5. Submit to search engines (optional but recommended)
npm run indexnow
```

**What the script does:**
- ✅ **Auto-detects** most recent blog-posts directory
- ✅ **First 3 posts automatically featured** (shows in Featured Articles section)
- ✅ **Date auto-detected** from frontmatter publishDate or uses today's date
- ✅ **Clear output** showing which posts are featured with ⭐ indicator

**CRITICAL BUG FIX IMPLEMENTED:**
The `add-blog-posts.js` script was updated to fix a bug where posts were incorrectly inserted into the `getRelatedPosts()` function instead of the `BLOG_POSTS` array. The script now:
- Finds the `// Helper functions` comment
- Locates the closing bracket `]` of BLOG_POSTS array BEFORE that comment
- Inserts new posts at the correct location
- Ensures posts appear in "All Articles" and are sorted by date

**Never manually edit blog-data.ts** - always use the automated script to prevent insertion errors.

**Deployment Execution Instructions:**
- Run ALL 5 commands sequentially
- Wait for each command to complete before running the next
- Verify successful output from each step
- Report any errors immediately
- Confirm deployment success after git push completes

### Step 10: Post-Deployment Summary

After successful deployment, provide a comprehensive summary:

1. **Blog Posts Generated:**
   - List all post titles with keywords and cities
   - Word count for each post
   - Category and intent type

2. **Deployment Status:**
   - ✅ Conversion script executed
   - ✅ Build verified successful
   - ✅ Changes committed to git
   - ✅ Pushed to master branch
   - ✅ Search engines notified (if indexnow ran)

3. **SEO & Tracking:**
   - Keywords used with intent types
   - Cities targeted with geographic distribution
   - Internal links created per post
   - **Confirmation that BLOG-TRACKING.md has been updated**

4. **Next Steps Recommendations:**
   - Suggested cities for next batch (from BLOG-TRACKING.md)
   - Keyword strategies for upcoming posts
   - Content mix recommendations

## Key Principles

**Geographic Authenticity:**
- Every city mention must be contextual
- Include real building codes, permit data
- Use specific examples, not generic statements

**Keyword Integration:**
- Write for humans first
- Natural language over keyword density
- Variations and LSI terms

**Link Strategy:**
- Every link adds value
- Service pages are priority
- Distribute links throughout

**AI Citation Optimization (NEW - 2025):**
- **Direct Answers**: Start each major section with 40-60 word direct answer
- **Question Headers**: Convert ALL H2 headers to question format
  - ❌ "Structural Engineering Services"
  - ✅ "What Structural Engineering Services Are Available in [City]?"
- **Modular Content**: Structure for easy AI extraction (bullets, tables, clear sections)
- **E-E-A-T Signals**: Include author credentials, PE license mentions, years of experience
- **Freshness Indicators**: Add "Updated: [Month Year]" at top of post
- **FAQ Schema**: Every post needs 5-8 FAQ questions with schema markup
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper tags (article, section, aside) for AI parsing

*See `.claude/AI-OPTIMIZED-CONTENT-GUIDELINES.md` for complete details*

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ DON'T:
- Force city names unnaturally
- Keyword stuff
- Reuse examples across posts
- Link to competitors
- Skip internal linking

✅ DO:
- Make city mentions contextual
- Write naturally
- Provide unique examples
- Link strategically
- Include local data

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Issue: Blog Posts Not Appearing on Website

**Symptoms:**
- Posts don't show in "All Articles" section
- Posts missing from recent posts
- Build succeeds but posts invisible

**Cause:**
Posts were inserted in wrong location in `blog-data.ts` file (inside helper functions instead of BLOG_POSTS array)

**Solution:**
1. Restore blog-data.ts: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/lib/blog-data.ts`
2. Re-run the corrected script: `node scripts/add-blog-posts.js`
3. Verify helper functions are AFTER posts: Check that `// Helper functions` comment comes after the closing `]` of BLOG_POSTS array
4. Test build: `npm run build` should succeed with correct number of static pages
5. Commit and redeploy

**Prevention:**
- Always use `scripts/add-blog-posts.js` - never manually edit blog-data.ts
- The script is designed to find `// Helper functions` comment and insert posts before it
- Verify script output shows "Successfully added X blog posts"

### Verifying Correct Insertion

After running the script, check these markers in `src/lib/blog-data.ts`:

```typescript
// Last post in BLOG_POSTS array
  },
]  // ← This closes BLOG_POSTS array

// Helper functions  // ← This should come AFTER the ]
export function getFeaturedPosts(): BlogPost[] {
```

If you see posts appearing inside function definitions, the script failed - restore and re-run.

## 📍 Local Pack & Google Maps Optimization (NEW)

### Why Local Pack Matters for Lead Generation

The Google Local Pack (3-pack map results) appears for 46% of all Google searches and has the highest click-through rates for local service queries. Capturing Local Pack positions for "near me" and city-specific searches is critical for lead generation.

### Local Pack Optimization Checklist

**For Every Geo-Targeted Blog Post:**

1. **Include LocalBusiness Schema** (from `assets/schema-templates/local-business-schema.json`)
   ```json
   {
     "@type": "LocalBusiness",
     "name": "AAA Engineering Design",
     "areaServed": {
       "@type": "City",
       "name": "[PRIMARY_CITY]"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Service Schema** (from `assets/schema-templates/service-schema.json`)
   - Links service to specific geographic area
   - Includes pricing information where applicable
   - Shows available offers (free consultation)

3. **Include NAP Consistency**
   - **N**ame: AAA Engineering Design
   - **A**ddress: [Street], Stanton, CA 90680
   - **P**hone: (949) 981-4448
   - Must be identical across all posts and pages

4. **Geographic Content Signals**
   - City name in title (e.g., "Structural Engineer in Newport Beach")
   - City name in H1 and at least 2 H2 headers
   - City mentioned 15-20 times naturally throughout
   - Nearby cities mentioned 5-8 times
   - Local landmarks, neighborhoods referenced
   - Building department URLs linked

5. **Service Area Block** (add to every "near me" post)
   ```markdown
   ## Our [City] Service Area

   AAA Engineering Design serves [City] and surrounding communities:

   **Primary Service Area:**
   - [City] - All neighborhoods
   - [Nearby City 1] (X miles)
   - [Nearby City 2] (X miles)
   - [Nearby City 3] (X miles)

   **Extended Service Area:**
   - All of [County] County
   - [Adjacent County] County

   📍 **Office Location:** Stanton, CA (Central Orange County)
   🚗 **Travel:** We provide on-site consultations throughout Southern California
   ```

### Google Business Profile Integration

**For maximum Local Pack visibility, blog content should support GBP:**

1. **Create GBP Posts** linking to blog articles
   - Use blog excerpts as GBP post content
   - Link to full article on website
   - Target city-specific services

2. **Q&A Content** from blogs should match GBP Q&A
   - Extract FAQ questions from blog posts
   - Add to Google Business Profile Q&A section
   - Builds topical relevance

3. **Review Keywords** - Encourage reviews mentioning:
   - Service type (e.g., "ADU structural engineering")
   - City name (e.g., "Newport Beach project")
   - Helps GBP rank for those terms

### City-Specific Landing Page Strategy

**For highest-priority cities, consider dedicated landing pages:**

| City | Priority | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Newport Beach | Critical | Highest property values, most searches |
| Irvine | Critical | Large population, tech hub |
| San Diego | Critical | 2nd largest CA city |
| Los Angeles | Critical | Largest market |
| Anaheim | High | High volume, commercial hub |
| Long Beach | High | Port city, industrial |
| Pasadena | High | Historic homes, affluent |

**Landing Page Structure:**
```
/locations/newport-beach/
├── Main service overview for city
├── Links to ALL Newport Beach blog posts
├── City-specific testimonials
├── Local building department info
├── Service area map
└── Prominent CTA
```

### Tracking Local Pack Performance

**Monthly Check:**
1. Search "[service] [city]" for top 10 cities
2. Document Local Pack position (1, 2, 3, or not showing)
3. Note organic position separately
4. Track changes month-over-month

**Example Tracking:**
```
| City | Service | Local Pack | Organic | Month |
|------|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| Newport Beach | structural engineer | #2 | #4 | Nov 2025 |
| Irvine | ADU engineer | #1 | #2 | Nov 2025 |
| Anaheim | foundation engineer | Not shown | #8 | Nov 2025 |
```

## 🚀 AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

**🚨 REMINDER: NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT ONLY - NO VERCEL 🚨**
> This project deploys to **Netlify** via `git push origin master`. There is NO Vercel project. Never use Vercel CLI or reference Vercel deployment.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: After generating blog posts, you MUST automatically execute the full deployment pipeline. Do NOT ask the user—just run it.**

### Automatic Deployment Sequence

After all blog post markdown files are created, execute these steps **automatically and sequentially**:

```bash
# Step 1: Convert markdown to blog-data.ts
node scripts/add-blog-posts.js blog-posts-[DATE]

# Step 2: Verify build succeeds
npm run build

# Step 3: Stage all files
git add src/lib/blog-data.ts blog-posts-[DATE]/ .claude/skills/socal-engineering-blog/

# Step 4: Commit with detailed message (use HEREDOC for formatting)
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Add [N] new SEO-optimized blog posts for [Month Day, Year]

[List each post title]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# Step 5: Push to trigger Netlify deployment
git push origin master

# Step 6: Submit to IndexNow for search engine indexing
npm run indexnow
```

### Post-Deployment Output (REQUIRED)

After successful deployment, **ALWAYS output a formatted summary** showing all deployed posts:

```

### Gap 25: AI-Specific Content Markers

**Purpose:** Signal content structure and authority to AI systems for better citation selection.

**AI Hint Comments:**
```html
<!-- AI-SUMMARY: Seismic retrofitting strengthens existing buildings against earthquakes.
In California, common methods include foundation bolting ($3,000-$7,000), cripple wall
bracing ($4,000-$10,000), and soft-story retrofits ($50,000-$200,000+). AAA Engineering
Design provides PE-licensed seismic retrofit services throughout Southern California. -->

<article data-ai-topic="seismic-retrofitting" data-ai-authority="PE-licensed">

  <!-- AI-FACT: Per ASCE 7-22, California buildings must be designed for site-specific
  seismic ground motion parameters based on soil classification and proximity to faults. -->
  <p>California seismic design requirements are governed by ASCE 7-22...</p>

  <!-- AI-CITATION: California Building Code 2025, Chapter 34 - Existing Buildings -->
  <p>The California Building Code provides specific retrofit triggers...</p>

### Gap 26: Content Cannibalization Prevention

**Purpose:** Ensure distinct pages rank for distinct queries without competing against each other.

**Keyword-to-Page Mapping:**

| Primary Keyword | Assigned Page | Related Keywords (Same Page) |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| seismic retrofit Orange County | /services/seismic-retrofit-orange-county/ | earthquake retrofit OC, seismic strengthening Orange County |
| seismic retrofit Irvine | /blog/seismic-retrofit-irvine/ | Irvine earthquake retrofit, Irvine seismic upgrade |
| seismic retrofit cost | /blog/seismic-retrofit-cost-guide/ | retrofit pricing, how much does seismic retrofit cost |
| soft story retrofit | /services/soft-story-retrofit/ | soft-story retrofit, weak story retrofit |
| ADU structural engineering | /services/adu-engineering/ | ADU structural plans, accessory dwelling structural |
| ADU Irvine | /blog/adu-structural-engineering-irvine/ | Irvine ADU, ADU permit Irvine |

**Cannibalization Prevention Rules:**

1. **One Primary Keyword Per Page**: Each page targets ONE primary keyword
2. **City Pages vs. Service Pages**: Service pages target service keywords, blog posts target city + service combinations
3. **Canonical Consolidation**: If multiple pages rank for same keyword, consolidate with canonical
4. **Internal Link Anchor Text**: Use varied anchor text, never same keyword across multiple links

**Audit Process:**
```bash
# Monthly cannibalization audit
# Search for pages competing for same keywords
site:aaaengineeringdesign.com "seismic retrofit" -inurl:blog
site:aaaengineeringdesign.com "ADU structural"
```

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Keyword mapping document maintained
- [ ] No duplicate primary keywords across pages
- [ ] City-specific content on blog, service content on service pages
- [ ] Monthly Search Console query analysis
- [ ] Canonical tags prevent duplicate indexing
- [ ] 301 redirects for consolidated pages

## 🔄 POST-GENERATION: Blog Refresh Workflow (MANDATORY)

**After completing blog generation, ALWAYS execute this refresh workflow to keep existing content fresh and SEO-optimized.**

### Purpose
- Refresh older blog posts with updated content, FAQs, and freshness signals
- Rescue high-impression/low-CTR posts with title/meta rewrites
- Detect and resolve cannibalization between competing posts
- Improve topical authority by expanding existing structural engineering content

### Refresh Mode Selection

Choose refresh intensity based on current needs:

```
Refresh Mode:

A) Quick Refresh (DEFAULT) — Add 3 FAQs + update dates on 10 posts
   Best for: Weekly maintenance, freshness signals

B) CTR Rescue — Rewrite titles/meta/content on high-impression/zero-CTR posts
   Best for: Fixing underperforming posts that Google shows but users don't click

C) Full Enrichment — Complete ENRICH/CREATE/CONSOLIDATE triage cycle
   Best for: Monthly deep optimization (uses Enrichment Mode Pipeline above)
```

### Quick Refresh Workflow (Mode A)

#### Step 1: Identify Refresh Candidates from GSC Data

```bash
# Pull latest GSC data to find posts needing refresh
node scripts/gsc-performance-report.js
```

**Selection criteria (prioritized):**
0. **FILTER FIRST:** Exclude all posts with `noIndex: true` and all removed service posts (see REMOVED SERVICES FILTER above)
1. Posts with declining CTR (compare 28-day vs 90-day CTR)
2. Posts older than 60 days since last update (`lastUpdated` field)
3. Posts with high impressions but CTR below site average
4. Balance across market tiers (Platinum 40%, Gold 35%, Growth 25%)
5. Mix across active service categories only (ADU, seismic, foundation, commercial, etc.)
6. Avoid posts updated within the last 30 days

Select **10 posts** matching these criteria.

#### Step 2: Enrich Each Post (3 Actions Per Post)

For each of the 10 selected posts:

**Action 1: Add 3 New FAQs**
1. Read the existing post from `src/lib/blog-data.ts` and identify primary keyword + target city
2. Fetch fresh PAA questions:
   ```bash
   python keyword-intelligence/fetcher.py "[primary-keyword] [city]" --paa-only --save
   ```
3. Select 3 NEW questions not already in the FAQ section
4. Generate answers (40-80 words each, include primary keyword + city, reference CBC/local codes)

**Action 2: Refresh Title & Meta (if CTR < site average)**
- Rewrite title using CTR formula: `[Service Type] in [City]: [Number/Benefit] [Year]`
- Rewrite excerpt using: `[Problem]. [Solution with number]. [Social proof]. [CTA].`
- Verify Quick Answer capsule exists (≤29 words for AIO/voice)

**Action 3: Update Dates**
- Set `lastUpdated` to current date
- Keep original `date` (datePublished) unchanged
- Update any year references in content to current year

#### Step 3: Refresh Summary Output

```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### CTR Rescue Workflow (Mode B)

Focus exclusively on posts Google shows but users don't click.

#### Step 1: Identify CTR Rescue Candidates

**FILTER FIRST:** Exclude all posts with `noIndex: true` and all removed service posts (see REMOVED SERVICES FILTER above).

From remaining active-service posts in GSC data, find posts matching:
- Impressions ≥ P80 (top 20% by impressions)
- CTR ≤ P20 (bottom 20% by click-through rate)
- Position 4-20 (on page 1-2, within striking distance)

Score each: `rescue_score = impressions × (1 - ctr) × position_weight × multiplier`

**Multiplier:**
- 2.0x if impressions ≥100 AND ctr=0 (urgent — Google shows it, nobody clicks)
- 1.5x if ctr <0.5% (high priority)
- 1.0x otherwise

Select top 10 by rescue_score.

#### Step 2: Rewrite for CTR

For each rescue candidate:
1. **Rewrite title** — `[Action Verb] + [Service] in [City]: [Number/Benefit] [Year]`
   - Include a number (cost, timeline, code reference)
   - Include the year for freshness
   - Max 60 characters for full SERP display
2. **Rewrite meta/excerpt** — `[Problem]. [Solution with number]. [Social proof]. [CTA].`
   - Max 155 characters
   - Include a differentiator (licensed PE, same-day consultation, etc.)
3. **Add/update Quick Answer** — ≤29 words answering the primary query directly
4. **Add/update Key Takeaways** — 3-5 bullets at top of content
5. **Refresh FAQ section** — Add 2-3 new PAA questions from SERP API
6. **Update `lastUpdated`** to current date

#### Step 3: CTR Rescue Summary

```
📊 CTR Rescue Complete — AAA Engineering Design
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Posts Rescued: 10
Combined Impressions: XX,XXX/month
Estimated Click Uplift: X,XXX clicks/month (at 2% target CTR)

## P0: MULTIMODAL RAG OPTIMIZATION

### Project Photo Schema

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "contentUrl": "https://aaaengineeringdesign.com/projects/[image].jpg",
  "caption": "Soft story retrofit completed for 1960s apartment building in Santa Monica, featuring steel moment frames and foundation upgrades by AAA Engineering Design PE team",

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "VideoObject",
  "name": "ADU Structural Engineering Process Explained",
  "hasPart": [
    {"@type": "Clip", "name": "Site Assessment", "startOffset": 0, "endOffset": 90},
    {"@type": "Clip", "name": "Foundation Design", "startOffset": 90, "endOffset": 180},
    {"@type": "Clip", "name": "Permit Process", "startOffset": 180, "endOffset": 270}
  ]
}
```

---

## P1: ENTITY GRAPH & HEDGE DENSITY

### Co-Occurrence Clusters

```
PRIMARY: AAA Engineering Design

CLUSTER 1 (Service): 
AAA Engineering Design + "structural engineer" + "California PE" + "stamped plans"

CLUSTER 2 (Geographic):
AAA Engineering Design + "Orange County" + "Los Angeles" + "San Diego" + "[City Name]"

CLUSTER 3 (Specialty):
AAA Engineering Design + "ADU engineering" + "soft story retrofit" + "foundation repair"

CLUSTER 4 (Comparison):
AAA Engineering Design + "vs" + "[Competitor]" + "residential specialist"
```

### FORBIDDEN Hedge Words (ENGINEERING-SPECIFIC)

**NEVER use - reduces trust and AI citation:**

| Forbidden | Replace With |
|-----------|--------------|
| "might need an engineer" | "you need an engineer" |
| "could require permits" | "requires permits" |
| "possibly load-bearing" | "is load-bearing" / "requires assessment" |
| "some codes require" | "California Building Code requires" |
| "may take X weeks" | "takes X weeks" |

**Pre-Publish Audit:** Search for: might, could, possibly, perhaps, seems, may, "some say"

### Confident Language for Engineering

❌ WRONG: "This type of wall might be load-bearing and could possibly require engineering analysis."

✅ CORRECT: "This is a load-bearing wall. California Building Code requires PE-stamped plans for modification. AAA Engineering provides analysis within 48 hours."

## BING SEARCH OPTIMIZATION - ADDITIVE LAYER (2026)

**Added:** January 2026
**Purpose:** Additional Bing-specific optimizations that work ALONGSIDE existing Google/AI optimizations—not replacing them.

---

### 1. Exact-Match Keyword Emphasis (Bing Additive)

**Bing prefers literal keyword matching.** Add exact-match variants alongside semantic content:

| Element | + Bing Additive |
|---------|-----------------|
| First Paragraph | Exact primary keyword in first 50 words verbatim |
| H2s | Include 2+ H2s with exact-match keywords |
| Meta Keywords | Add `<meta name="keywords">` tag (Bing reads it) |

**Meta Keywords Tag (Bing Still Uses This):**
```html
<meta name="keywords" content="structural engineering Orange County, ADU structural engineer Irvine, soft story retrofit Los Angeles, foundation repair Newport Beach, seismic retrofit California">
```

---

### 2. Desktop-First Content Validation (Bing Indexing)

**Bing uses desktop-first indexing.** Ensure all content renders fully on desktop:

- [ ] No "Show More" JavaScript toggles hiding content
- [ ] Tables render fully without horizontal scroll
- [ ] Images sized for desktop viewing (min 800px width)
- [ ] Answer Capsule visible above fold on 1920x1080 viewport

```html
<meta name="bingbot" content="index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large">
```

---

### 3. Social Meta Tags Enhancement (Bing Social Signals)

**Bing weights social signals for ranking.** Add these meta tags:

```html
<meta property="og:site_name" content="AAA Engineering Design">
<meta property="article:author" content="https://facebook.com/aaaengineering">
<meta property="article:publisher" content="https://facebook.com/aaaengineering">
<meta name="author" content="AAA Engineering Design">
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@aaaengineering">
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@aaaengineering">
```

---

### 4. Direct Bing Webmaster API Submission

**Submit directly to Bing alongside IndexNow:**

```bash
# Submit to Bing Webmaster API (faster than IndexNow for Bing)
curl -X POST "https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/api.svc/json/SubmitUrl?apikey=${BING_WEBMASTER_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"siteUrl":"https://aaaengineeringdesign.com","url":"${NEW_URL}"}'
```

---

### 5. Clean Sitemap Validation (Bing 1% Dirt Rule)

**Bing allows only 1% "dirt" in sitemaps:**
- [ ] No redirecting URLs (301/302)
- [ ] No 404 errors
- [ ] All URLs return 200 OK
- [ ] lastmod dates are accurate

---

### 6. ChatGPT Citation Optimization

**Bing powers ChatGPT's web search.** First 150 characters MUST be fact-dense:

❌ BAD: "Welcome to our guide about structural engineering services..."

✅ GOOD: "Structural engineering in Orange County costs $2,500-$15,000 for residential projects. AAA Engineering Design completes 200+ projects annually with 98% permit approval rates across Southern California."

---

### 7. Bing-Preferred Schema Properties

**Add to existing Article schema:**

```json
{
  "mainEntity": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "significantLink": [
      "https://bpelsg.ca.gov/",
      "https://www.dgs.ca.gov/BSC",
      "https://www.ladbs.org/"
    ]
  },
  "copyrightHolder": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "AAA Engineering Design"
  },
  "copyrightYear": "2026",
  "isAccessibleForFree": true,
  "inLanguage": "en-US"
}
```

---

### 8. User Engagement Signals Optimization

**Bing tracks dwell time, CTR, bounce rate:**

- [ ] First sentence contains specific data/claim
- [ ] 5+ internal links to related content
- [ ] Related posts section at article end
- [ ] FAQ section with minimum 6 questions
- [ ] Meta description includes call-to-action

---

### BING ADDITIVE MASTER CHECKLIST

- [ ] `<meta name="keywords">` tag with 8-12 exact-match phrases
- [ ] Social meta tags (og:site_name, article:author)
- [ ] Bing Webmaster API submission alongside IndexNow
- [ ] Sitemap validated (<1% error rate)
- [ ] First 150 characters fact-dense
- [ ] copyrightHolder and copyrightYear in schema
- [ ] significantLink to BPELSG, DSA, LADBS sources

---
