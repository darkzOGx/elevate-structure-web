# Blog Post Tracking - Keywords & Cities Used

## Last Updated: December 20, 2025

## 🔄 **COMPLETE ROTATION CYCLE RULE** (Implemented Nov 13, 2025)

**CRITICAL RULE: NO city can be reused until ALL 103 cities have been used in that rotation cycle.**

### How It Works:
1. **Cycle Start**: All 103 cities begin as "Available"
2. **As Posts Generate**: Cities move to "Used This Cycle"
3. **Cycle Completion**: Once all 103 cities used, cycle resets
4. **Reuse Allowed**: Only after complete cycle (all 103 cities exhausted)

### Benefits:
- ✅ Maximum geographic SEO coverage across all of Southern California
- ✅ No city over-saturation
- ✅ Fair distribution across all markets
- ✅ Better long-term domain authority
- ✅ Prevents keyword cannibalization
- ✅ Complete SoCal footprint (OC + LA + SD + Riverside + San Bernardino)

### Tracking:
- **Current Cycle**: Cycle 4 (Started Dec 13, 2025)
- **Cycle 1**: COMPLETED ✅ (All 103 cities used)
- **Cycle 2**: COMPLETED ✅ (All 103 cities used)
- **Cycle 3**: COMPLETED ✅ (All 105 cities used - Dec 13, 2025)
- **Total Cities**: 115+ (added Platinum/Gold tier cities: La Jolla, Calabasas, Pacific Palisades, Bel Air, Atherton, Menlo Park, Studio City, Sunnyvale, West Hollywood, Los Altos Hills, Santa Monica)
- **Cycle 4 Cities Used**: 105+/115+
- **Cycle 4 Status**: COMPLETING - Extended roster with Platinum/Gold cities
- **Dec 20, 2025**: 25 posts (12 Foundation Hub 6 + 8 Residential + 5 Near Me)

## 🎯 **SELECTION STRATEGY FOR NEXT POSTS**

### Rule Enforcement:
- ✅ **ONLY select from "Available" cities** (78 cities with green checkmarks)
- ❌ **NEVER reuse cities marked "USED THIS CYCLE"** (25 cities with red X)
- ✅ Once all 103 cities used → Cycle 2 begins → All cities reset to "Available"

### Recommended Selection Pattern:
**For each batch of 8 posts:**
- 3-4 cities from **Priority 1** (OC near office, especially **Stanton**!)
- 1-2 cities from **Priority 2-3** (LA County high-value/volume)
- 1-2 cities from **Priority 4-5** (San Diego coastal/volume)
- 1 city from **Priority 6-8** (Riverside/San Bernardino expansion)

### Example Next 8 Posts (Geographic Diversity):
1. **Stanton** ⭐ (Priority 1 - YOUR LOCATION!)
2. **Brea** (Priority 1 - OC)
3. **Placentia** (Priority 1 - OC)
4. **Cypress** (Priority 1 - OC)
5. **Manhattan Beach** (Priority 2 - LA luxury $2.5M)
6. **Del Mar** (Priority 4 - SD ultra-luxury $3.5M)
7. **Riverside** (Priority 6 - IE county seat 331K pop)
8. **Rancho Cucamonga** (Priority 8 - SB affluent $680K)
