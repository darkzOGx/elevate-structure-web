## Keyword Assignment Rules

### For Each Blog Post:
1. **Primary Keyword**: The main focus keyword (from table above)
2. **Secondary Keywords** (2-3): Related keywords to weave naturally
3. **Local Keyword Variant**: City + primary keyword (e.g., "structural engineer Long Beach")
4. **Long-Tail Variations** (3-5): Natural language queries from GSC

### Example for "When to Hire Residential Structural Engineer":
- **Primary**: When to Hire Residential Structural Engineer
- **Secondary**: residential structural engineer near me, cost of structural engineer, residential home engineering
- **Local**: When to Hire Structural Engineer in Long Beach
- **Long-Tail**: 
  - do i need a structural engineer for a remodel
  - when is a structural engineer required in california
  - structural engineer requirements for home addition
  - hiring structural engineer for foundation problems

## Keyword Density Guidelines
- Primary keyword: 1-1.5% density
- Include primary keyword in: Title, H1, First paragraph, One H2, Meta description, URL slug
- Secondary keywords: 0.5-1% density each
- Natural language: Prioritize readability over keyword stuffing
- LSI Keywords: Use related terms naturally (e.g., "structural engineering" → "load-bearing," "foundation design," "seismic analysis")
