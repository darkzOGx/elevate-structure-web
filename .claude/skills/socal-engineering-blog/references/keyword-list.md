## 🔗 KEYWORD + CITY PAIRING RULES

### Mandatory Matching:

1. **Residential keywords** → Residential archetype cities (San Diego, Irvine, Anaheim, etc.)
2. **Commercial keywords** → Commercial archetype regions (LA, SD, OC, Inland Empire)
3. **Compliance keywords** → Compliance archetype cities (Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Pasadena, Long Beach, LA)
4. **Emergency keywords** → Any city

### Examples of CORRECT Pairing:

✅ "ADU structural engineer" + Irvine
✅ "second story addition engineer" + San Diego
✅ "tilt up structural engineer" + Los Angeles
✅ "soft-story retrofit" + Santa Monica
✅ "commercial structural engineer" + Orange County

### Examples of WRONG Pairing:

❌ "soft-story retrofit" + Irvine (not a compliance city)
❌ "tilt up structural engineer" + residential-only city
❌ "ADU structural engineer" + commercial-only context

## 📊 CONTENT GENERATION PRIORITY

When selecting keywords for a batch:

1. **Check Compliance Deadlines** → Prioritize compliance keywords for cities with active deadlines
2. **Balance Archetypes** → Mix residential, commercial, and compliance content
3. **Local Intent** → Add "near me" and city modifiers for local SEO
4. **Never Mix Archetypes** → Each post targets ONE archetype
