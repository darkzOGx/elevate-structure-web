## Writing Guidelines

### Tone & Style
- Professional but accessible
- Use "we," "our," "you" naturally
- California Professional Engineers speaking to clients
- Confident but not arrogant
- Helpful, consultative tone

### Geographic Integration Rules
1. **Primary City**: Mentioned 15-20 times throughout
2. **Secondary Cities**: 5-8 mentions total (varies)
3. **Regions**: 3-5 mentions (Orange County, LA County, etc.)
4. **Never force it**: Only mention cities where contextually relevant

### Keyword Integration
- Primary keyword in title, H1, first paragraph, one H2, conclusion
- Density: 1-1.5% for primary keyword

  - Location pages if they exist (0-1 link)
- Use descriptive anchor text with keywords
- Link early (first 500 words) and throughout

### External Linking Strategy
- 2-3 external authority links
- Target:
  - Local building department websites
  - California Building Standards Commission
  - Professional organizations (ASCE, SE AOC, ICC)
  - Code resources
- Open in new tabs
- Use for credibility, not SEO

### Length Targets
- Pillar articles: 3,000-5,000 words
- Cluster articles: 1,500-2,500 words
- PAA/FAQ articles: 1,200-1,800 words

### Formatting Requirements

- Use numbered lists for processes/steps
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
