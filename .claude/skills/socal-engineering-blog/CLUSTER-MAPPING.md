## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Create **Hub 1: Structural Engineering Services Guide** (links to 24 posts)
2. ✅ Create **Hub 2: Engineering Design Services Guide** (links to 28 posts)
3. ⏳ Build out Hub 4 & Hub 5 with 8-10 more cluster posts each before creating hub pages

### Content Gaps to Fill:
- **Hub 4 (Compliance)** needs: Permit processes, building inspections, code updates, plan review
- **Hub 5 (Commercial)** needs: Office buildings, retail, industrial, multi-family, mixed-use

### Linking Strategy:
- All 24 posts under Hub 1 should link back to hub page
- All 28 posts under Hub 2 should link back to hub page
- Hubs should cross-link where relevant (e.g., Hub 1 → Hub 4 for code compliance)
