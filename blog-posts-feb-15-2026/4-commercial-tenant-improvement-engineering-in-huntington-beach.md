## What Is Commercial Tenant Improvement Engineering in Huntington Beach?

Commercial tenant improvement engineering is the structural design work required when modifying a commercial space for a new tenant's use. In Huntington Beach, this work is necessary whenever a TI project involves changes to the building's structural system, including:

- **Removing or modifying load-bearing walls** — Opening up spaces for larger retail floors, open-concept restaurants, or collaborative office environments.
- **Creating new openings in existing walls** — Installing pass-through windows, service counters, new doorways, or display openings.
- **Adding mezzanines or loft levels** — Installing intermediate floor levels for storage, offices, or additional customer space.
- **Supporting heavy equipment** — Designing structural supports for commercial kitchen equipment, medical imaging devices, industrial machinery, or heavy storage systems.
- **Modifying roof structures** — Adding rooftop HVAC units, solar panel systems, or rooftop dining areas.
- **Reinforcing floors** — Upgrading floor systems for high-density file storage, server rooms, gym equipment, or heavy retail displays.
- **Fire-rated assembly modifications** — Maintaining or establishing fire-rated wall and ceiling assemblies per CBC requirements when reconfiguring spaces.

The Huntington Beach Community Development Department, located at 2000 Main Street, requires PE-stamped structural plans for all TI projects that affect the building's structural system. Even seemingly minor modifications — like cutting a new doorway through an existing wall — can involve load-bearing elements that demand engineering analysis.

### Types of Tenant Improvements Requiring Structural Engineering

| TI Type | Common Structural Needs | Typical Engineering Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Restaurant / Food Service | Kitchen equipment pads, hood supports, grease trap pits, wall removals | $4,000 - $10,000 |
| Medical / Dental Office | X-ray room shielding walls, heavy equipment support, ADA modifications | $3,000 - $8,000 |
| Retail Store | Wall removals for open floor plan, storefront modifications, sign support | $2,500 - $6,000 |
| Fitness / Gym | Heavy equipment support, floor reinforcement, mezzanine additions | $3,500 - $9,000 |
| Office Space | Wall removals, new openings, mezzanine additions | $2,500 - $7,000 |
| Warehouse / Industrial | Mezzanine additions, crane supports, dock levelers, equipment pads | $4,000 - $12,000 |
| Brewery / Winery | Tank supports, floor reinforcement, walk-in cooler pads | $3,500 - $10,000 |

Huntington Beach has a diverse commercial real estate market, from the beach-front retail on Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street to the industrial parks along Gothard Street and Bolsa Avenue. Each building type and commercial use presents distinct structural engineering requirements.

## How Much Does Commercial TI Engineering Cost in Huntington Beach?

Structural engineering costs for commercial tenant improvements in Huntington Beach depend on the project scope, building type, and complexity of structural modifications:

| Service Component | Cost Range | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Initial structural assessment | $500 - $1,000 | 1-2 days |
| Structural calculations package | $1,500 - $4,000 | 1-2 weeks |
| Structural plan set | $2,000 - $6,000 | 1-3 weeks |
| Plan check response support | $500 - $2,000 | As needed |
| Construction observation | $200 - $500 per visit | During construction |
| **Total Engineering Package** | **$2,500 - $12,000** | **2-6 weeks** |

### Factors That Drive TI Engineering Costs in Huntington Beach

1. **Scope of structural modifications** — A simple wall removal costs less to engineer than a multi-opening, mezzanine-addition project.
2. **Building age and type** — Older Huntington Beach commercial buildings (pre-1980) often have limited as-built documentation, requiring more on-site investigation.
3. **Building material** — Steel-frame, concrete tilt-up, wood-frame, and masonry buildings each require different analysis methods and detailing.
4. **Occupancy change** — Changing the building's use (e.g., from retail to restaurant, or office to gym) triggers additional structural analysis for different live load requirements.
5. **Fire-rated assemblies** — Modifications to fire-rated walls and ceilings require specific engineering documentation to maintain fire resistance ratings.
6. **ADA compliance** — Structural modifications for ADA compliance (ramps, accessible restrooms, path-of-travel upgrades) add engineering scope.

Huntington Beach TI engineering costs are generally comparable to Costa Mesa and Irvine. Newport Beach and Westminster projects tend to fall within the same range, though Newport Beach coastal zone properties may incur modest premiums for wind and corrosion requirements.

## What Is the TI Engineering Process in Huntington Beach?

Our commercial tenant improvement engineering process is designed for efficiency and first-pass permit approval:

### Step 1: Project Assessment

Our engineers begin every Huntington Beach TI project with a thorough assessment:

- **On-site building evaluation** — Visiting the space to document existing structural conditions, framing types, wall locations, and current load paths.
- **As-built plan review** — Obtaining original building plans from the Huntington Beach Building Division or the landlord to understand the existing structural system.
- **Proposed TI plan review** — Analyzing the architect's or tenant's proposed layout to identify all structural modifications needed.
- **Load analysis preliminary check** — Quickly verifying whether the existing structure can support the proposed use without major reinforcement.

### Step 2: Structural Analysis and Design

Based on the assessment, our engineers perform detailed analysis:

- **Gravity load analysis** — Calculating new dead loads and live loads per CBC Table 1607.1. Commercial live loads range from 50 psf (office) to 100 psf (retail/assembly) to 150 psf (heavy storage).
- **Load-bearing wall analysis** — Determining whether walls proposed for removal or modification are load-bearing and designing steel beams, headers, or posts to carry the redirected loads.
- **Lateral system analysis** — Evaluating the impact of wall removals on the building's seismic and wind resistance. Designing compensating shear walls or moment frames if needed.
- **Mezzanine design** — Full structural design of mezzanine framing, columns, connections, and lateral bracing per CBC Section 505 requirements.
- **Equipment support design** — Designing pads, platforms, hangers, and anchorage for commercial equipment.
- **Connection design** — Engineering the connections between new and existing structural elements using Simpson Strong-Tie hardware, steel plates, or welded connections.

### Step 3: Plan Preparation

Our team produces a complete structural plan set:

- Structural framing plans showing all modifications
- Foundation plans for new columns, equipment pads, or mezzanine footings
- Structural details for beams, connections, and reinforcement
- Shear wall schedule (if lateral system is affected)
- Fire-rated assembly details (when applicable)
- Structural notes and material specifications
- Special inspection requirements per CBC Chapter 17

### Step 4: Huntington Beach Permit Submittal

We submit structural plans to the Huntington Beach Community Development Department. For commercial TI projects:

- **Plan check timeline** — 3-6 weeks for first review, depending on project complexity.
- **Plan check fees** — Based on project valuation per the city's fee schedule.
- **Express plan check** — Available for eligible projects, reducing review time to 1-2 weeks.
- **Corrections handling** — Our team responds to all plan check corrections directly, minimizing review cycles.

### Step 5: Construction Support

During construction, we provide:

- Pre-construction coordination with the general contractor
- Special inspection coordination for structural steel, concrete, and connections
- Field modification engineering when unexpected conditions are encountered
- Final structural observation and sign-off documentation

## What Are Fire-Rated Assembly Requirements for Huntington Beach TI Projects?

Fire-rated assemblies are one of the most critical — and frequently misunderstood — aspects of commercial tenant improvement engineering. In Huntington Beach, the CBC requires fire-rated separations between:

### Occupancy Separations

When a TI project changes the occupancy type or involves mixed occupancies, fire-rated wall and floor/ceiling assemblies are required per CBC Table 508.4:

| Separation Type | Required Rating | Common Application |
|---|---|---|
| Business (B) to Mercantile (M) | 1-hour | Office adjacent to retail |
| Assembly (A-2) to Business (B) | 2-hour | Restaurant adjacent to office |
| Storage (S) to Business (B) | 1-hour | Warehouse adjacent to office |
| Hazardous (H) to any occupancy | 2-4 hour | Chemical storage, industrial |

### Corridor and Exit Enclosure Ratings

- **Exit corridors** — 1-hour rated per CBC Section 1020.1 (with exceptions for sprinklered buildings)
- **Exit stairways** — 1-hour for buildings 4 stories or less, 2-hour for taller buildings per CBC Section 1023.2
- **Exit passageways** — 1-hour minimum per CBC Section 1024.3

### Tenant Demising Walls

Walls separating tenant spaces in multi-tenant buildings must maintain fire ratings per CBC and the building's original design:

- Typical 1-hour rating for tenant separation
- Must extend from the structural floor to the underside of the structural roof/floor deck above
- Penetrations (ducts, pipes, conduits) must be fire-stopped per CBC Section 714

### How TI Modifications Affect Fire Ratings

When a Huntington Beach TI project involves modifications to fire-rated assemblies, our structural engineers address:

- **New openings in rated walls** — Fire-rated door assemblies, fire shutters, or rated glazing must be specified.
- **Penetrations** — New mechanical, electrical, and plumbing penetrations through rated assemblies must be fire-stopped with listed systems.
- **Ceiling modifications** — Removing ceiling tiles or modifying the ceiling grid in a rated assembly requires maintaining the rated system.
- **Structure exposure** — Exposing structural steel that was previously protected by fire-rated enclosures requires fire-proofing restoration.

Our engineers at AAA Engineering & Design document all fire-rated assembly requirements on the structural plans, ensuring the Huntington Beach plan checker approves the project without fire-rating-related corrections.

## What ADA Compliance Considerations Apply to Huntington Beach TI Projects?

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the California Building Code (CBC Chapter 11B) impose accessibility requirements on commercial tenant improvements. When a TI project exceeds certain cost thresholds, the scope of required ADA upgrades expands:

### Threshold Trigger

California's "path of travel" requirements are triggered when TI construction costs exceed $182,174 (2026 threshold, adjusted annually). When triggered, the property owner must spend up to 20% of the TI construction cost on accessibility improvements along the path of travel from the public way to the area of improvement.

### Common ADA Structural Engineering Requirements

| ADA Element | Structural Engineering Involvement | Typical Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Accessible ramp construction | Foundation and framing for permanent ramps | $3,000 - $8,000 |
| Accessible restroom renovation | Wall relocation, grab bar blocking, floor modifications | $2,000 - $5,000 |
| Door widening | Header and jamb modifications for 36" clear width | $500 - $2,000 per opening |
| Floor level changes | Ramp or lift support structure | $2,000 - $6,000 |
| Counter height modifications | Structural support for lowered service counters | $500 - $1,500 |

Our structural engineers incorporate ADA-required structural modifications into the TI engineering plans from the start, preventing costly redesigns and plan check rejections. The Huntington Beach Building Division enforces ADA compliance strictly, and our team ensures every project meets the requirements on the first submittal.

## What Building Types Are Common for TI Projects in Huntington Beach?

Huntington Beach's commercial building stock includes several structural types, each requiring a different engineering approach:

### Concrete Tilt-Up Buildings

The most common commercial building type in Huntington Beach, particularly in the industrial areas along Gothard Street, Bolsa Avenue, and the Huntington Beach Industrial Park:

- **Structural characteristics** — Concrete wall panels tilted into place, steel or wood roof framing, concrete slab-on-grade floors.
- **TI engineering considerations** — New openings in tilt-up panels require steel header beams and careful analysis of panel stability. Mezzanine additions must connect to the tilt-up panels with engineered connections.
- **Common TI types** — Warehouse-to-office conversions, showroom buildouts, brewery installations, fitness studios.

### Wood-Frame Commercial Buildings

Common in older Huntington Beach commercial areas, particularly along Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway:

- **Structural characteristics** — Wood stud walls, wood or engineered wood floor/roof framing, raised or slab-on-grade foundations.
- **TI engineering considerations** — Load-bearing wall identification is critical. Wood buildings have more interconnected load paths, making wall removals more complex to engineer.
- **Common TI types** — Retail stores, restaurants, professional offices, art galleries.

### Steel-Frame Buildings

Found in newer commercial developments and larger commercial projects:

- **Structural characteristics** — Wide-flange steel columns and beams, steel bar joists for roof framing, metal deck with concrete fill for floors.
- **TI engineering considerations** — Steel is highly adaptable for TI modifications. New loads can often be supported by existing steel framing with connection modifications. Fire-proofing must be maintained or restored on all exposed steel.
- **Common TI types** — Medical offices, corporate offices, large retail spaces.

### Masonry Buildings

Older commercial buildings in Huntington Beach's downtown core:

- **Structural characteristics** — Concrete masonry unit (CMU) or brick walls, wood or steel roof framing.
- **TI engineering considerations** — Masonry walls are often load-bearing and lateral force-resisting. New openings require careful analysis and steel lintel design. Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings require additional seismic evaluation.
- **Common TI types** — Restaurants, boutique retail, professional offices.

Our engineers at AAA Engineering & Design have experience with all these building types in Huntington Beach. We tailor our engineering approach to the specific structural system, ensuring efficient and cost-effective TI designs.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Commercial TI Engineering in Huntington Beach

### Do all tenant improvements in Huntington Beach require structural engineering?

Not all TI projects require structural engineering. Cosmetic improvements (painting, flooring, non-structural partitions) typically do not need PE-stamped structural plans. Structural engineering is required when the TI involves modifying load-bearing walls, creating openings in structural walls, adding mezzanines, supporting heavy equipment, changing occupancy types that increase floor loads, or modifying fire-rated assemblies. When in doubt, contact the Huntington Beach Community Development Department or call AAA Engineering & Design for a free assessment.

### How do I know if a wall is load-bearing in my Huntington Beach commercial space?

Load-bearing walls carry the weight of the roof, floor, or other walls above them down to the foundation. Signs of a load-bearing wall include: running perpendicular to floor/roof joists, located directly above a foundation wall or beam, supporting posts or beams above, and constructed with larger framing members than partition walls. Only a licensed structural engineer should make the final determination. Removing a load-bearing wall without proper engineering creates a serious structural safety hazard and code violation.

### What is the occupancy classification for my Huntington Beach TI project?

The CBC classifies commercial spaces by occupancy type: Group A (Assembly — restaurants with 50+ occupants, gyms), Group B (Business — offices, banks), Group M (Mercantile — retail stores), Group F (Factory/Industrial), Group S (Storage), and Group H (Hazardous). The occupancy classification determines live load requirements, fire-rated assembly requirements, exiting requirements, and ADA obligations. Our engineers identify the correct classification and design accordingly.

### Can I add a mezzanine to my Huntington Beach commercial space?

Yes, mezzanines are a popular way to add usable space in Huntington Beach commercial buildings, especially in tilt-up warehouses with high ceilings. CBC Section 505 permits mezzanines in industrial occupancies (up to 1/3 of the room floor area) and other occupancies (up to 1/3 of the room area). Mezzanines require structural engineering for the framing, columns, connections, lateral bracing, and guardrails. Our engineers design mezzanine additions that maximize your usable space within code requirements.

### What special inspections are required for Huntington Beach TI projects?

CBC Chapter 17 requires special inspections for certain construction activities within TI projects: structural steel welding and bolting, concrete placement for equipment pads and mezzanine footings, anchor bolt installation, fire-stopping installation, and spray-applied fireproofing. Our structural plans specify all required special inspections, and we coordinate with approved special inspection agencies to ensure compliance.

### How does the Huntington Beach express plan check work?

The Huntington Beach Community Development Department offers an express plan check service that reduces the review timeline from 3-6 weeks to 1-2 weeks. Express plan check is available for eligible projects and requires an additional fee (typically 50-100% premium over standard plan check fees). Our team can advise whether your project qualifies and whether the additional cost is justified by your project timeline.

### What is the typical construction timeline for a Huntington Beach TI buildout?

Construction timelines for Huntington Beach TI projects vary by scope: minor buildouts (cosmetic + minor structural) take 4-8 weeks, moderate buildouts (wall removals, new openings, equipment support) take 8-16 weeks, and major buildouts (mezzanines, occupancy changes, extensive structural modifications) take 12-24 weeks. Engineering and permitting typically add 6-12 weeks before construction begins. Engaging our team early and using express plan check when eligible minimizes the pre-construction timeline.

### Can my landlord's structural engineer review my TI plans?

Some Huntington Beach commercial landlords require that their designated structural engineer review and approve tenant improvement plans that affect the building's structural system. This is separate from the city plan check process and is a condition of the lease. Our engineers coordinate with landlord-designated engineers to ensure compatibility between the TI modifications and the building's overall structural system.
