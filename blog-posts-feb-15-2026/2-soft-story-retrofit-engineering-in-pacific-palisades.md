## What Is a Soft-Story Building and Why Is It Dangerous in Pacific Palisades?

A soft-story building is a multi-story structure where one floor — typically the ground level — is significantly weaker and more flexible than the floors above it. The most common configuration is an apartment building or mixed-use structure with a parking garage, retail space, or open carport at ground level, with residential units above.

The "soft story" condition creates a critical vulnerability during earthquakes:

- **Lateral stiffness discontinuity** — The open ground floor lacks sufficient shear walls or bracing to resist horizontal earthquake forces.
- **Torsional irregularity** — Uneven distribution of stiffness causes the building to twist during shaking, concentrating damage at the weak story.
- **Collapse mechanism** — Without retrofit, the ground floor can pancake under the weight of upper floors, as documented in the 1994 Northridge earthquake where 16 people died in soft-story building collapses.

Pacific Palisades faces elevated seismic risk due to its proximity to multiple active faults:

- **Santa Monica Fault** — Runs directly through the southern portion of Pacific Palisades, capable of producing a magnitude 6.6+ earthquake.
- **Malibu Coast Fault** — Located offshore to the west, contributing to the regional seismic hazard.
- **Hollywood Fault** — Part of the larger fault system affecting the entire Los Angeles basin.

The USGS estimates a 60% probability of a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake in Southern California within the next 30 years. For Pacific Palisades soft-story buildings, retrofit engineering is not optional — it is essential for life safety.

## What Does LA Ordinance 183893 Require for Pacific Palisades Buildings?

Los Angeles Ordinance 183893, enacted in 2015, is the city's mandatory seismic retrofit law for soft-story buildings. Every Pacific Palisades property owner with a qualifying building must understand and comply with this ordinance.

### Which Buildings Are Covered?

The ordinance applies to wood-frame buildings that meet ALL of the following criteria:

- **Built under building permits applied for before January 1, 1978**
- **Contain two or more stories**
- **Have a soft, weak, or open-front ground floor condition**
- **Contain two or more dwelling units** (or contain commercial/residential mixed use)

In Pacific Palisades, this captures a significant number of apartment buildings along Sunset Boulevard, in the Alphabet Streets area, and along the commercial corridors near Palisades Village.

### Compliance Deadlines and Penalties

The City of Los Angeles established a phased compliance timeline:

| Phase | Building Type | Original Deadline | Current Status (2026) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Buildings with 3+ stories AND 16+ units | Passed | Enforcement active |
| Phase 2 | Buildings with 3+ stories OR 16+ units | Passed | Enforcement active |
| Phase 3 | All remaining qualifying buildings | Passed | Enforcement active |

**All deadlines have now passed.** Property owners who have not yet complied face:

- **Order to Comply** — Issued by LADBS with specific deadlines for plan submittal and construction completion.
- **Fines and penalties** — Daily fines for non-compliance, escalating over time.
- **Potential rent restrictions** — Non-compliant buildings may face restrictions under the Los Angeles Housing Department.
- **Liability exposure** — In the event of earthquake damage, non-compliance creates significant legal liability for property owners.

The 2025 Pacific Palisades fires have added urgency. Buildings that sustained fire damage and are now being reconstructed must incorporate soft-story retrofits as part of the rebuilding process. The City of Los Angeles has streamlined permitting for fire reconstruction projects that include seismic upgrades.

### Post-Fire Reconstruction and Retrofit Integration

The 2025 Pacific Palisades fires destroyed or damaged hundreds of structures. For soft-story buildings undergoing fire reconstruction, this presents a unique opportunity:

- **Combined permits** — LADBS allows combined fire reconstruction and seismic retrofit permits, reducing fees and timeline.
- **Insurance coordination** — Structural engineering for the seismic retrofit can be documented separately for insurance purposes.
- **Code upgrade requirements** — Rebuilt structures must meet current CBC 2022 requirements, which often exceed the minimum retrofit standards.
- **Cost efficiency** — Integrating the retrofit with fire reconstruction is 30-40% less expensive than performing them as separate projects.

Our team at AAA Engineering & Design has extensive experience with post-fire structural engineering. We coordinate with LADBS, insurance adjusters, and general contractors to streamline the combined retrofit and reconstruction process for Pacific Palisades property owners.

## How Much Does Soft-Story Retrofit Engineering Cost in Pacific Palisades?

Soft-story retrofit costs in Pacific Palisades vary based on building size, configuration, and the specific retrofit system selected. Here is a comprehensive cost breakdown:

### Engineering Design Costs

| Service Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Initial building assessment | $500 - $1,500 | On-site evaluation |
| Structural engineering calculations | $2,000 - $6,000 | Analysis and design |
| Structural plan set | $3,000 - $8,000 | Complete permit-ready plans |
| LADBS plan check support | $500 - $2,000 | Corrections and responses |
| Construction observation | $1,000 - $3,000 | Site visits during construction |
| **Total Engineering** | **$3,000 - $15,000** | **Based on building complexity** |

### Construction Costs

| Building Size | Typical Construction Cost | Per Unit Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 2-4 units (small apartment) | $60,000 - $120,000 | $15,000 - $30,000 |
| 5-15 units (medium apartment) | $100,000 - $200,000 | $10,000 - $20,000 |
| 16+ units (large apartment) | $150,000 - $400,000+ | $8,000 - $18,000 |
| Mixed-use (commercial/residential) | $120,000 - $350,000 | Varies |

### Cost Factors Specific to Pacific Palisades

Several factors unique to Pacific Palisades influence retrofit costs:

1. **Hillside conditions** — Many Pacific Palisades buildings are built on sloped lots, requiring specialized foundation work and hillside-specific engineering.
2. **Fire damage integration** — Buildings with fire damage require combined structural assessment and dual-purpose engineering.
3. **Parking configuration** — Tuck-under parking is the most common soft-story condition in Pacific Palisades, and the retrofit must maintain parking access.
4. **Access constraints** — Narrow streets and hillside lots in Pacific Palisades create construction access challenges that affect costs.
5. **Historic considerations** — Some Pacific Palisades buildings have historical significance that requires sensitive retrofit approaches.

Compared to neighboring communities, Pacific Palisades retrofit costs are generally 10-20% higher than Brentwood or Santa Monica due to the hillside and access factors. Malibu projects tend to cost more due to Coastal Commission requirements, while Beverly Hills projects vary based on the city's specific plan check requirements.

## What Structural Systems Are Used for Soft-Story Retrofits in Pacific Palisades?

Our structural engineers select from several proven retrofit systems based on each Pacific Palisades building's specific conditions:

### Steel Moment Frames

Steel moment frames are the most common retrofit system for Pacific Palisades soft-story buildings:

- **How it works** — Rigid steel frames are installed at the open ground floor, providing lateral resistance through beam-column connections that resist bending.
- **Advantages** — Maintains open parking and access, minimal disruption to tenants, proven earthquake performance.
- **Design details** — Wide-flange columns (typically W10 or W12 sections) with fully welded beam connections, base plates with anchor bolts into new concrete footings.
- **Cost** — $30,000 - $80,000 for the steel frame portion of the retrofit.

Steel moment frames are ideal for Pacific Palisades tuck-under parking configurations because they provide the required lateral strength without blocking parking spaces or reducing ground-floor clearance.

### Plywood Shear Walls

For buildings where open ground-floor space is less critical:

- **How it works** — Structural plywood panels are nailed to new or existing framing, creating rigid shear walls that resist lateral forces.
- **Advantages** — Lower cost than steel, faster installation, effective for moderate retrofit requirements.
- **Limitations** — Reduces open space at the ground floor, requires continuous foundation support.
- **Design details** — 15/32" or 19/32" structural plywood with 8d or 10d nails at specified spacing, Simpson Strong-Tie hold-downs at each end.

### Cantilevered Column Systems

For hillside Pacific Palisades buildings with significant slope:

- **How it works** — Reinforced concrete or steel columns are embedded deep into the hillside, cantilevering up to support the building above.
- **Advantages** — Works well on slopes, addresses both soft-story and hillside stability concerns.
- **Design considerations** — Requires geotechnical investigation, deeper foundations, and coordination with hillside grading requirements.

### Steel Brace Frames

An alternative to moment frames:

- **How it works** — Diagonal steel braces (typically HSS tubes or wide-flange members) are installed in the ground-floor openings.
- **Advantages** — Very high stiffness, effective for buildings requiring maximum lateral resistance.
- **Limitations** — Partially obstructs openings, which can affect parking access or storefront visibility.

Our engineers at AAA Engineering & Design evaluate each Pacific Palisades building and recommend the optimal system. For many projects, we use a combination of systems — steel moment frames at parking entrances and plywood shear walls at solid wall locations — to balance cost, performance, and functionality.

## What Is the Soft-Story Retrofit Engineering Process for Pacific Palisades Buildings?

Our engineering process follows a systematic approach designed to deliver code-compliant results efficiently:

### Phase 1: Building Assessment and Documentation

- **On-site survey** — Our engineers visit the Pacific Palisades property to document existing conditions, including framing type, foundation configuration, ground-floor openings, and any existing damage.
- **Existing plans review** — We obtain original building plans from LADBS records when available to understand the as-built construction.
- **Deficiency identification** — We identify specific soft-story deficiencies: inadequate shear walls, missing hold-downs, insufficient foundation anchorage, and torsional irregularities.

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis

- **Seismic force calculation** — Using ASCE 7-22 and the CBC 2022, we calculate the seismic demands on the building based on Pacific Palisades' site-specific parameters (Site Class C/D, Seismic Design Category D).
- **Existing capacity evaluation** — We determine the current lateral resistance of the ground floor and compare it to the seismic demand.
- **Retrofit system design** — Based on the deficiency analysis, we design the retrofit system (steel moment frames, shear walls, or combination) to bring the building into compliance.
- **Foundation design** — New footings, grade beams, or foundation modifications needed to support the retrofit elements.

### Phase 3: Plan Preparation and Submittal

- **Structural plan set** — Complete drawings including retrofit framing plans, foundation plans, connection details, steel fabrication details, and structural notes.
- **Calculation package** — Bound structural calculations documenting the analysis and design per CBC and ASCE 7-22.
- **LADBS plan check submittal** — We submit plans to the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. Current plan check times for soft-story retrofits are 4-8 weeks.
- **Plan check corrections** — Our team handles all plan check responses and corrections directly with LADBS.

### Phase 4: Construction Support

- **Pre-construction meeting** — We meet with the general contractor and steel fabricator to review plans, clarify details, and establish inspection protocols.
- **Special inspection coordination** — Soft-story retrofits require special inspections for structural steel welding, anchor bolt installation, and concrete placement per CBC Chapter 17.
- **Field observation** — Our engineers visit the site during critical construction phases to verify the work matches the design intent.
- **Final documentation** — We provide the building owner with as-built documentation and a compliance letter for LADBS.

## How Does Pacific Palisades Fire Reconstruction Affect Soft-Story Retrofit Requirements?

The 2025 Pacific Palisades fires created an unprecedented situation for soft-story building owners. Here is how fire damage intersects with retrofit requirements:

### Buildings with Partial Fire Damage

Buildings that sustained partial fire damage but remain structurally viable must:

- Complete the soft-story retrofit as part of the repair process
- Upgrade fire-damaged structural elements to current CBC 2022 standards
- Address any pre-existing code deficiencies identified during the fire damage assessment
- Obtain combined repair and retrofit permits from LADBS

### Buildings Requiring Substantial Reconstruction

When fire damage exceeds 50% of the building's value, LADBS typically requires full code compliance for the entire structure:

- The soft-story condition must be fully corrected in the reconstruction
- All structural systems must meet current CBC 2022 and ASCE 7-22 requirements
- New construction provides the opportunity to incorporate modern seismic design features
- Insurance claims can cover the full reconstruction including seismic improvements

### Cost Benefits of Combined Projects

Combining fire reconstruction with soft-story retrofit delivers significant cost savings:

| Approach | Engineering Cost | Construction Cost | Total Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Separate retrofit only | $5,000 - $12,000 | $80,000 - $200,000 | Baseline |
| Combined fire reconstruction + retrofit | $8,000 - $15,000 | $60,000 - $150,000 (retrofit portion) | 25-40% savings |

The savings come from shared mobilization costs, elimination of duplicate foundation work, and the ability to design the retrofit into the reconstruction. Our team at AAA Engineering & Design provides comprehensive structural assessments that address both fire damage evaluation and soft-story retrofit design in a single, coordinated engineering package.

## What Building Codes Govern Soft-Story Retrofits in Pacific Palisades?

Soft-story retrofits in Pacific Palisades must comply with multiple code requirements:

### Los Angeles Ordinance 183893

The primary mandate requiring retrofits. Key provisions include:

- Defines qualifying buildings and compliance categories
- Establishes minimum retrofit standards based on ASCE 41-17 (Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings)
- Requires structural plans prepared by a California-licensed Professional Engineer or Structural Engineer
- Mandates special inspections during construction

The CBC 2022 (Chapters 16, 17, 23, 34, and Appendix A3) provides the technical framework for structural design, special inspections, and retrofit-specific provisions. ASCE 7-22 supplies site-specific seismic parameters and load combinations for Pacific Palisades locations.

Our engineers at AAA Engineering & Design maintain current expertise in all applicable codes and standards. We design every Pacific Palisades soft-story retrofit to meet or exceed the minimum requirements, ensuring long-term structural safety and full regulatory compliance.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Soft-Story Retrofits in Pacific Palisades

### How do I know if my Pacific Palisades building needs a soft-story retrofit?

Your building likely requires a soft-story retrofit if it is a wood-frame structure with two or more stories, built before 1978, containing two or more dwelling units, and has a soft, weak, or open-front ground floor (such as tuck-under parking or large openings). The City of Los Angeles sent Order to Comply notices to qualifying buildings. If you are unsure, contact LADBS or call AAA Engineering & Design at (949) 981-4448 for a free assessment.

### What happens if I do not comply with Ordinance 183893 in Pacific Palisades?

Non-compliance triggers escalating penalties from LADBS, including daily fines, rent collection restrictions, and liability exposure in the event of earthquake damage. The City of Los Angeles actively enforces the ordinance, and Pacific Palisades properties receive focused attention due to the community's seismic risk profile.

### Can I pass the retrofit cost to my tenants in Pacific Palisades?

Los Angeles allows property owners to pass through a portion of the retrofit cost to tenants under the Rent Stabilization Ordinance. The specific pass-through amount is calculated based on the total retrofit cost, the number of units, and the applicable regulations. Our team can provide documentation that supports your pass-through application. Consult with a real estate attorney for specific legal guidance on your situation.

### Does the soft-story retrofit affect my Pacific Palisades building's parking?

Steel moment frame retrofits are specifically designed to maintain parking access and capacity. The steel columns and beams are positioned to preserve existing parking spaces. In most Pacific Palisades retrofit projects, we maintain 100% of the existing parking capacity. Plywood shear wall retrofits may reduce some ground-floor open space, but our engineers minimize this impact through strategic wall placement.

### How does earthquake insurance relate to the soft-story retrofit in Pacific Palisades?

A completed soft-story retrofit demonstrates that your Pacific Palisades building meets current seismic safety standards. Some insurance carriers offer reduced earthquake premiums for retrofitted buildings. The retrofit documentation we provide serves as evidence of the structural improvements for insurance purposes. Given Pacific Palisades' seismic risk, earthquake insurance is a wise investment regardless of retrofit status.

### What is the difference between a soft-story retrofit and a full seismic retrofit?

A soft-story retrofit specifically addresses the weak ground-floor condition by adding lateral resistance (steel frames, shear walls) at the ground level. A full seismic retrofit addresses all deficiencies throughout the entire building, including upper floors, roof connections, and foundation anchorage. Ordinance 183893 requires a soft-story retrofit at minimum, but building owners may elect a more comprehensive upgrade for additional safety. Our engineers at AAA Engineering & Design can design either scope based on your goals and budget.

### Can the soft-story retrofit be combined with other building improvements?

Many Pacific Palisades property owners combine the soft-story retrofit with tenant improvements, ADA upgrades, fire damage repairs, and energy efficiency improvements. Combining scopes reduces total project cost and disruption.

### How will the retrofit affect my Pacific Palisades tenants during construction?

Construction occurs at the ground floor level and does not require tenant relocation from upper-floor units. Temporary parking disruption is common during the 4-12 week construction period. Our engineers design retrofit systems that minimize construction impact on occupied units.
