# Mixed-Use Development Structural Engineering in Santa Monica: Complete 2026 Guide

Santa Monica is experiencing one of the most significant mixed-use development booms in Southern California. With transit-oriented development surging around the E Line (formerly Expo Line) stations at Downtown Santa Monica, 26th Street, and Bergamot, developers are building denser, taller, and more structurally complex projects than the city has seen in decades. The Downtown Santa Monica Specific Plan encourages high-density mixed-use projects along corridors like Ocean Avenue, Main Street, and the revitalized downtown core, creating unprecedented demand for specialized [commercial structural engineering](/services/commercial-structural-engineering) expertise.

At AAA Engineering Design, our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) and SE-certified structural engineers design mixed-use buildings throughout Santa Monica and the Westside. We understand the unique intersection of seismic demand, building code complexity, and architectural ambition that defines Santa Monica mixed-use projects. Call **(949) 981-4448** for a consultation on your next development.

> **Answer Capsule:** Mixed-use development structural engineering in Santa Monica requires PE-stamped designs that integrate residential, commercial, and parking uses into a single seismically resilient structure. Engineers design podium transfers, lateral force systems, and foundations that satisfy both California Building Code and Santa Monica's local amendments, including soft-story and sustainability mandates.

## What Is Mixed-Use Development Structural Engineering?

Mixed-use development structural engineering is the specialized discipline of designing buildings that combine two or more occupancy types within a single structure. In Santa Monica, this typically means residential units above ground-floor retail, office space integrated with housing, or live-work configurations that blend commercial and residential functions vertically or horizontally.

The structural complexity of mixed-use buildings far exceeds single-use construction. When a five-story residential building sits atop a ground-floor commercial space with an underground parking garage, the structural engineer must reconcile three fundamentally different structural grids, load paths, and performance requirements within one cohesive system.

### Primary Mixed-Use Structural Types in Santa Monica

**Podium Construction** represents the dominant mixed-use typology in Santa Monica. A concrete or steel podium (typically one to two stories) houses commercial space and parking at grade, while wood-frame or light-gauge steel residential floors rise above. The podium level contains transfer beams and columns that redirect loads from the residential grid above to the commercial grid below. This is the most common approach for projects along Main Street, Ocean Avenue, and the downtown core.

**Wrap Construction** positions residential units around a central parking structure, creating an integrated envelope that maximizes density while concealing the parking garage. This approach is gaining traction in Santa Monica's transit-oriented zones near the E Line stations, where developers want to minimize surface parking and maximize street-level activation.

**Hybrid Steel-and-Concrete Construction** serves mid-rise projects of seven stories and above. These buildings use structural steel or reinforced concrete moment frames throughout, with concrete core walls providing lateral resistance. Several projects currently in design along Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica use this approach to reach permitted height limits.

Understanding these structural typologies is fundamental to successful mixed-use development. For a broader overview of commercial building design principles, see our [commercial and industrial structural engineering guide](/blog/commercial-industrial-structural-engineering-guide).

## What Types of Mixed-Use Projects Are Being Built in Santa Monica?

Santa Monica's development pipeline in 2026 reflects the city's commitment to dense, transit-accessible, and sustainable mixed-use construction. Here are the primary project types driving structural engineering demand.

### Residential-Over-Retail

The most prevalent mixed-use format in Santa Monica places three to six stories of residential apartments or condominiums above ground-floor retail or restaurant space. Along Montana Avenue, Main Street, and the Third Street Promenade periphery, these projects define the streetscape. Structural engineers must design column-free retail bays at ground level (often 25 to 40 feet clear span) while supporting a completely different structural grid for the residential floors above.

Projects in this category typically range from 30 to 120 units with 5,000 to 25,000 square feet of commercial space. The structural engineering challenge centers on the transfer level, where loads from closely spaced residential bearing walls must be redirected through transfer beams to widely spaced commercial columns below.

### Transit-Oriented Development

Santa Monica's three E Line stations have catalyzed significant transit-oriented development (TOD). The Bergamot station area, the 17th Street/SMC station zone, and the Downtown Santa Monica terminus all have active or planned mixed-use projects. These TOD projects typically achieve higher densities, with buildings reaching five to seven stories and incorporating reduced parking ratios.

From a structural engineering perspective, TOD projects in Santa Monica present unique challenges. Higher density means greater seismic mass, requiring more robust lateral systems. Reduced parking ratios still demand below-grade or podium-level parking, adding excavation and shoring complexity in Santa Monica's sandy coastal soils.

### Live-Work and Creative Office Hybrids

Venice-adjacent areas and the Bergamot Arts District in Santa Monica support live-work developments that blend residential and creative commercial space. These projects often feature open floor plans, high ceilings, and exposed structural elements as architectural features. The structural engineer must design systems that accommodate these open spans while maintaining seismic performance.

### Affordable and Workforce Housing Mixed-Use

Santa Monica's affordable housing requirements mandate that many mixed-use developments include income-restricted units. Projects utilizing state density bonus provisions can exceed base zoning height and density limits, which directly impacts structural design. A project that gains two additional floors through density bonus requires a fundamentally different structural system than the base-zoned building. Our [structural engineering services](/services/structural-engineering) address these evolving code and zoning requirements.

## How Does the Mixed-Use Structural Design Process Work in Santa Monica?

The structural design process for a mixed-use building in Santa Monica follows a systematic progression from feasibility through construction administration. Each phase builds on the previous one, and mistakes or omissions early in the process cascade into costly problems later.

### Phase 1: Feasibility and Concept Design (4-6 Weeks)

Before committing to a structural system, the engineer evaluates site-specific conditions including soil type, groundwater depth, adjacent structures, and seismic hazard. In Santa Monica, the coastal geology introduces variables that inland sites rarely encounter. Shallow groundwater tables complicate below-grade construction, and sandy alluvial soils require specific foundation strategies.

During concept design, the structural engineer works with the architect to establish the building's structural grid, identify the podium transfer level, and select the primary lateral force-resisting system. For most Santa Monica mixed-use projects, this means choosing between special reinforced concrete shear walls, steel special moment frames, or a combination of both.

**Key deliverables:** Structural concept narrative, preliminary column grid, foundation type recommendation, and rough construction cost estimate for the structural scope.

### Phase 2: Schematic and Design Development (8-12 Weeks)

This phase transforms the concept into a coordinated structural design. The engineer sizes all primary members (columns, beams, shear walls, transfer elements), designs the foundation system, and coordinates with the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers to ensure structural elements do not conflict with building systems.

In Santa Monica mixed-use projects, this phase is where the complexity of podium transfer design becomes fully apparent. Transfer beams spanning 30+ feet while carrying five stories of residential loading above demand careful analysis. The engineer must verify that deflection limits are met (typically L/360 for floor members supporting non-structural elements) and that the building's overall drift performance satisfies code limits.

### Phase 3: Construction Documents and Permitting (6-10 Weeks)

The structural engineer produces PE-stamped construction documents for submission to the Santa Monica Building & Safety Division. Santa Monica's plan check process for mixed-use buildings is thorough and can involve multiple review cycles. The city requires full structural calculations, a geotechnical report, and detailed construction drawings that demonstrate compliance with the California Building Code (CBC 2022) and all local amendments.

**Pro tip:** Santa Monica's plan review for mixed-use projects typically takes 8 to 14 weeks for the initial review cycle. Budget for at least one resubmittal cycle, which adds 4 to 6 weeks. Having a structural engineer familiar with Santa Monica's plan check priorities reduces resubmittal risk.

### Phase 4: Construction Administration (Duration of Construction)

During construction, the structural engineer reviews shop drawings, responds to requests for information (RFIs), conducts field observations at critical milestones (foundation pour, podium transfer level, shear wall placement), and issues supplemental instructions as field conditions require. For a typical Santa Monica mixed-use project, construction administration spans 18 to 30 months.

## What Are Santa Monica's Specific Structural Requirements for Mixed-Use?

Santa Monica imposes several local requirements that go beyond the baseline California Building Code. Mixed-use developers and their structural engineers must navigate these provisions carefully.

### Soft-Story Retrofit and New Construction Standards

Santa Monica's mandatory [seismic retrofitting](/services/seismic-retrofitting) ordinance requires existing soft-story buildings to be strengthened. For new mixed-use construction, the spirit of this ordinance drives Santa Monica's plan reviewers to scrutinize ground-floor open-front conditions with particular rigor. Any new mixed-use building with a ground-floor commercial level that has large window openings or open storefronts triggers detailed analysis to demonstrate that the ground floor is not a soft-story weak link.

The structural engineer must demonstrate through analysis that the stiffness ratio between adjacent stories does not exceed code thresholds. In practice, this means designing robust concrete or steel moment frames at the ground level that compensate for the reduced shear wall area caused by commercial storefronts.

### Seismic Design Triggers

Santa Monica falls within Seismic Design Category D (SDC D) under ASCE 7-22, the seismic loading standard referenced by the 2022 CBC. This classification triggers mandatory requirements including:

- **Special seismic detailing** for all lateral force-resisting elements (special moment frames, special shear walls)
- **Redundancy factor (rho = 1.3)** unless the building qualifies for rho = 1.0 through multiple lateral system lines
- **Deformation compatibility** checks for all gravity-only columns and frames
- **Diaphragm design** per ASCE 7-22 Section 12.10, including the alternative diaphragm design procedure for precast concrete and wood diaphragms

For mixed-use buildings with a podium, the seismic design becomes particularly nuanced at the transition level. The upper wood-frame structure and the lower concrete podium have dramatically different stiffness characteristics, creating force concentrations that require careful engineering.

### Height Limits and Zoning Constraints

Santa Monica's zoning designations control maximum building height, which directly impacts structural system selection. In the Downtown Santa Monica Specific Plan area, heights up to 84 feet are permitted in certain subdistricts, allowing buildings of seven to eight stories. Along the boulevards in West LA-adjacent areas and near the Mar Vista border, heights are more restricted at 32 to 45 feet (three to four stories).

Height limits influence whether a project uses Type V wood-frame construction over a Type I concrete podium (up to five stories of wood over one to two stories of concrete) or requires non-combustible construction throughout (Type I or Type II steel and concrete). This decision has enormous cost implications, as non-combustible construction can cost 40 to 60 percent more per square foot than wood-over-podium construction.

### Sustainability and Green Building Requirements

Santa Monica's Green Building Ordinance applies to all new construction exceeding specified thresholds. While the sustainability requirements are primarily architectural and mechanical, they impact structural engineering through requirements for solar-ready roofs (structural loading for photovoltaic systems), EV-ready parking (electrical infrastructure coordination), and enhanced insulation assemblies (thicker wall and floor sections that affect structural dimensions).

## How Much Does Mixed-Use Structural Engineering Cost in Santa Monica?

Structural engineering fees for mixed-use projects in Santa Monica vary based on building size, structural complexity, soil conditions, and the number of design iterations required. Below are current 2026 fee ranges based on our project experience.

### Per-Unit Cost Benchmarks

| Project Size | Structural Fee Per Unit | Total Structural Fee Range |
|---|---|---|
| 10-30 units (3-4 stories, podium) | $2,800 - $4,500 | $30,000 - $135,000 |
| 30-80 units (5-6 stories, podium) | $2,200 - $3,500 | $66,000 - $280,000 |
| 80-150 units (7+ stories, concrete/steel) | $1,800 - $3,000 | $144,000 - $450,000 |

### Per-Square-Foot Cost Benchmarks

For the structural engineering design fees (not construction costs):

- **Wood-over-podium (Type V/I):** $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot of total building area
- **Full concrete or steel (Type I):** $2.50 to $5.00 per square foot
- **Below-grade parking structures:** $2.00 to $4.00 per square foot of parking area

### What Drives Cost Variation?

Several factors push Santa Monica mixed-use structural engineering fees toward the higher end of these ranges:

1. **Below-grade construction** with dewatering requirements (common in coastal Santa Monica where groundwater is shallow)
2. **Complex transfer conditions** where commercial column grids do not align with residential bearing walls
3. **Adjacent building shoring** requirements in dense urban infill sites along Main Street or downtown
4. **Height and density bonus provisions** that increase the building beyond base zoning
5. **Accelerated schedules** requiring overlapping design phases

These fees represent 1.5 to 3.0 percent of total construction cost, which is consistent with industry standards for mixed-use construction in the greater Los Angeles market. Given that structural engineering errors can cost 10 to 50 times the engineering fee to remediate during construction, investing in experienced engineering is the highest-return decision a developer can make.

## What Are the Common Structural Challenges in Santa Monica Mixed-Use Projects?

Every mixed-use project in Santa Monica presents structural challenges that demand experienced engineering judgment. These are the issues we encounter most frequently.

### Podium Transfer Design

The podium level is the single most critical structural element in a mixed-use building. At this level, loads from the upper residential structure must transfer through beams and columns to the lower commercial structure, which typically has a completely different column grid. Transfer beams in Santa Monica mixed-use projects commonly span 28 to 36 feet, carry concentrated loads of 200 to 500 kips, and must limit deflection to prevent cracking in the finishes above.

Design challenges at the podium level include:

- **Punching shear** at transfer beam-to-column connections
- **Torsional effects** when transfer beams are loaded eccentrically
- **Post-tensioned slab coordination** when the podium uses PT concrete
- **Construction sequencing** to ensure shoring supports upper floors until the transfer level achieves design strength

### Below-Grade Parking and Foundation Challenges

Many Santa Monica mixed-use projects include one to two levels of below-grade parking. In the coastal zone west of Lincoln Boulevard, groundwater can be encountered at depths of 8 to 15 feet below grade. This creates several structural challenges:

- **Hydrostatic uplift** on the basement slab requiring tie-down systems or heavier slabs
- **Waterproof membrane coordination** with structural penetrations
- **Temporary shoring and dewatering** during construction, which can affect adjacent properties in dense urban areas near Culver City and Venice

Foundation systems for Santa Monica mixed-use projects typically use mat foundations or drilled piers (caissons) bearing in competent sand or sandstone layers. The geotechnical conditions vary significantly across the city, and projects near the bluffs have different soil profiles than those along the flatlands toward Venice or West LA.

### Lateral System Complexity

Mixed-use buildings must resist earthquake and wind forces through a lateral force-resisting system (LFRS). In Santa Monica's SDC D classification, the LFRS must be a "special" system with enhanced ductility and detailing. The challenge in mixed-use design is that the lateral system must work continuously from the roof through the podium to the foundation, despite the dramatic change in building stiffness at the podium transition.

Common lateral system configurations for Santa Monica mixed-use include:

- **Special reinforced concrete shear walls** extending from foundation through all levels (most common)
- **Special steel moment frames** at the podium with wood shear walls above
- **Buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBFs)** for projects requiring maximum architectural flexibility at ground level

Each system has different implications for architectural planning, construction cost, and construction schedule. The structural engineer's system recommendation is one of the most consequential decisions in the project's development.

### Adjacent Building and Neighbor Concerns

Santa Monica's dense urban fabric means most mixed-use construction sites are adjacent to existing buildings. Construction vibration, excavation-induced settlement, and shoring design require careful engineering to protect neighboring structures. In areas like Main Street, Ocean Park, and the downtown core, buildings frequently share property lines with minimal setbacks.

The structural engineer must design shoring systems that maintain the stability of adjacent structures, specify vibration monitoring protocols, and coordinate with geotechnical engineers to predict and control ground movement during excavation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does structural engineering take for a mixed-use project in Santa Monica?

A typical Santa Monica mixed-use project requires 18 to 28 weeks from structural concept through construction document completion. Plan check review adds 8 to 14 weeks for initial review plus 4 to 6 weeks per resubmittal cycle. Total time from engagement to building permit is typically 7 to 12 months.

### Do I need a separate structural engineer for below-grade parking?

No. The structural engineer of record designs the entire building, including below-grade parking levels. However, you will need a separate geotechnical engineer to provide the soil investigation and foundation recommendations that the structural engineer uses as design input.

### What is the difference between a podium and a pedestal building?

Both terms describe a concrete or steel base structure supporting lighter construction above. In California practice, "podium" is the standard term. The podium typically includes one to two levels of parking and/or commercial space, with a concrete transfer slab at the top that supports wood-frame or light-gauge steel residential construction above.

### Can wood-frame construction be used above five stories in Santa Monica?

Under current California Building Code, Type V (wood-frame) construction is limited to five stories over a Type I (concrete) podium. Projects exceeding this threshold must use Type III (heavy timber/mass timber) or Type I/II (concrete or steel) construction for the upper floors, which significantly increases structural cost.

### How does Santa Monica's soft-story ordinance affect new mixed-use buildings?

The soft-story ordinance primarily targets existing buildings for mandatory retrofit. However, the ordinance's principles influence plan check review of new mixed-use construction. Plan reviewers scrutinize ground-floor irregularities with heightened attention, and the structural engineer must demonstrate that ground-floor commercial openings do not create a soft-story condition through detailed stiffness analysis.

### What seismic performance level should a Santa Monica mixed-use building target?

Code-minimum design targets Life Safety performance in a design-level earthquake (approximately 475-year return period) and Collapse Prevention in a maximum considered earthquake (approximately 2,475-year return period). Developers seeking enhanced resilience can specify Immediate Occupancy or operational performance levels, which require more robust structural systems and higher engineering investment.

### How do density bonus provisions affect structural design?

State density bonus provisions allow developers to exceed base zoning height and density limits in exchange for providing affordable housing units. Each additional floor gained through density bonus increases the building's seismic weight, modifies the dynamic response, and may trigger a change in structural system. The structural engineer must design for the full density-bonus building, not just the base-zoned configuration.

### Does AAA Engineering Design handle permit expediting in Santa Monica?

While we do not provide permit expediting services directly, we have extensive experience with the Santa Monica Building & Safety Division's plan check process.
