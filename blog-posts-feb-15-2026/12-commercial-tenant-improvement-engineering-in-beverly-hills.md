## What Is Commercial Tenant Improvement Engineering?

Commercial tenant improvement engineering encompasses the structural design and analysis required when modifying a commercial space for a new or existing tenant's use. In Beverly Hills, this work spans the full spectrum of commercial property types — from ground-floor retail on Brighton Way to multi-story office suites in Century City-adjacent towers to restaurant conversions in the Beverly Center area.

A licensed [structural engineer](/services/structural-engineering) evaluates how proposed modifications affect the building's load paths, lateral force-resisting system, and overall structural integrity. The engineering deliverables include calculations, PE-stamped structural drawings, and construction specifications that the Beverly Hills Building & Safety Division requires for permit issuance.

### Types of Commercial TI Projects Requiring Structural Engineering

**Office Build-Outs.** Beverly Hills attracts entertainment industry offices, law firms, financial services companies, and tech startups that demand open floor plans, conference rooms with full-height glass partitions, and server rooms with reinforced floors. Structural engineering addresses wall removals, new opening headers, floor load increases, and mechanical equipment support.

**Retail Build-Outs.** Luxury retail tenants along Rodeo Drive, Beverly Drive, and Wilshire Boulevard invest heavily in dramatic storefront modifications, multi-level retail environments, sculptural interior elements, and vault-style storage rooms. These build-outs frequently involve structural steel moment frames, cantilevered display features, and reinforced floors for heavy merchandise.

**Restaurant and Hospitality Build-Outs.** Beverly Hills restaurants require engineering for commercial kitchen equipment loads (walk-in coolers weighing 3,000-8,000 pounds), hood and exhaust penetrations through roof structures, bar and dining mezzanines, rooftop dining platforms, and grease interceptor installations that affect slab integrity.

**Medical and Dental Build-Outs.** Medical tenants require structural support for imaging equipment (MRI machines weighing 12,000-25,000 pounds), lead-lined radiation walls, vibration isolation systems, and reinforced ceiling systems for surgical light booms. Beverly Hills has a dense concentration of medical offices that regularly undergo TI renovations.

**Fitness and Wellness Build-Outs.** High-end fitness studios, spas, and wellness centers in Beverly Hills need floor reinforcement for heavy exercise equipment, pool and hydrotherapy installations, sauna structural enclosures, and vibration isolation to protect adjacent tenants.

## What Types of Tenant Improvements Require Structural Engineering in Beverly Hills?

Not every TI project requires a structural engineer, but Beverly Hills enforces strict plan check standards. The following modifications trigger a structural engineering requirement:

### Load-Bearing Wall Modifications

Removing, relocating, or creating openings in load-bearing walls is the most common trigger for structural engineering in TI projects. In Beverly Hills commercial buildings, load-bearing walls are found in:

- Older masonry buildings (pre-1970) along South Beverly Drive and in the business triangle
- Tilt-up concrete buildings in commercial zones near La Cienega Boulevard
- Wood-frame commercial structures in mixed-use zones adjacent to West Hollywood

Engineering involves designing steel beams, headers, or moment frames to carry loads previously supported by the wall. A typical load-bearing wall removal in a Beverly Hills commercial space requires $3,500 to $8,000 in structural engineering fees.

### Mezzanine and Loft Additions

Adding a mezzanine level within a high-ceiling commercial space is popular in Beverly Hills retail and office environments. Structural engineering determines column locations, beam sizes, connection details, floor loading capacity, and lateral bracing requirements. Beverly Hills enforces California Building Code (CBC) requirements that mezzanines cannot exceed one-third of the floor area of the room they occupy.

### Floor Opening Enlargements and New Stairways

Creating new stairways, elevator shafts, or floor openings between levels requires cutting through existing floor diaphragms. This work demands careful engineering to maintain diaphragm continuity, transfer lateral loads around the opening, and support the new framing. Beverly Hills commercial buildings along Wilshire Boulevard frequently undergo this type of modification during multi-floor tenant consolidations.

### Seismic Upgrade Triggers

Beverly Hills sits within the seismically active Los Angeles Basin. When a TI project exceeds certain cost thresholds relative to the building's value, the Beverly Hills Community Development Department may trigger mandatory seismic upgrades under CBC Section 3403.4. Specifically:

- **Alterations exceeding 50% of building value** trigger a full seismic evaluation
- **Change of occupancy** to a higher-risk category requires seismic compliance review
- **Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings** face mandatory retrofit requirements under the City of Los Angeles URM ordinance, which Beverly Hills references in its own standards

Our engineers evaluate seismic triggers early in the project to prevent costly surprises during plan check.

### Rooftop Equipment Installation

Installing HVAC units, solar panels, rooftop signage, or antenna systems on Beverly Hills commercial buildings requires structural analysis of the existing roof system. Equipment loads, wind loads, and seismic anchorage must comply with CBC standards and Beverly Hills-specific requirements for rooftop installations visible from public rights-of-way.

### Facade and Storefront Modifications

Beverly Hills commercial tenants, particularly along Rodeo Drive, invest significantly in custom storefronts. Widening storefront openings, installing cantilevered canopies, adding exterior signage structures, and modifying building facades all require structural engineering to maintain building integrity and comply with the city's architectural review standards.

---

## How Does the TI Engineering Process Work?

Our tenant improvement engineering process follows four phases designed to deliver permit-ready plans on the timeline Beverly Hills commercial tenants demand.

### Phase 1: Site Assessment and Existing Conditions (1-2 Weeks)

We begin every Beverly Hills TI project with a thorough site assessment:

- **Field investigation** — Our engineers visit the space to document existing structural conditions, wall compositions, floor systems, roof framing, and foundation types.
- **Original drawing review** — We obtain and analyze the building's original structural drawings from the Beverly Hills Building & Safety Division records or the property owner's files.
- **Destructive and non-destructive testing** — For older Beverly Hills buildings where original drawings are unavailable, we use ground-penetrating radar, rebar scanning, and selective demolition to determine structural composition.
- **Load path analysis** — We trace gravity and lateral load paths through the existing structure to identify which elements are critical to building performance.

### Phase 2: Structural Design and Engineering (2-4 Weeks)

With existing conditions documented, our engineers design the structural modifications:

- **Gravity load analysis** — Calculate new load distributions resulting from wall removals, mezzanine additions, or equipment installations.
- **Lateral load analysis** — Evaluate how modifications affect the building's seismic and wind resistance systems. Beverly Hills requires compliance with ASCE 7-22 load standards and CBC 2025 seismic provisions.
- **Connection design** — Detail steel-to-steel, steel-to-concrete, and steel-to-wood connections using current code requirements.
- **Specification development** — Write structural specifications for materials, welding procedures, special inspections, and construction sequencing.

### Phase 3: Permitting and Plan Check (3-8 Weeks)

The Beverly Hills Community Development Department at 455 North Rexford Drive processes commercial TI permits through their Building & Safety Division. Our permitting support includes:

- **Permit application preparation** — Complete structural plan sets with calculations, details, and specifications formatted to Beverly Hills submission standards.
- **Plan check response** — Address examiner comments and corrections within 48 hours of receiving plan check letters.
- **Coordination with other disciplines** — Work with the project architect, MEP engineers, and fire protection consultants to resolve interdisciplinary comments.

Beverly Hills plan check timelines for commercial TI projects average 4-6 weeks for standard review and 2-3 weeks for expedited review (available for an additional fee from the city). Our pass rate on first-submission plan check exceeds 85%, significantly reducing the typical revision cycle.

### Phase 4: Construction Support and Inspection (Duration of Construction)

Structural engineering responsibility extends beyond plan approval:

- **RFI responses** — Answer contractor questions about structural details, substitutions, and field conditions within 24 hours.
- **Shop drawing review** — Review steel fabrication drawings, connection hardware submittals, and concrete mix designs.
- **Special inspection coordination** — Coordinate with ICC-certified special inspectors for welding, high-strength bolting, concrete placement, and epoxy anchor installations.
- **Field observation** — Conduct site visits at critical construction milestones to verify structural work matches the approved plans.

## What Are Beverly Hills-Specific Building Code Requirements for TI Projects?

Beverly Hills maintains its own municipal code with amendments to the California Building Code that affect commercial TI projects.

### Beverly Hills Community Development Department Requirements

The Beverly Hills Building & Safety Division enforces several requirements beyond the base CBC:

- **Architectural Commission review** — Commercial projects along Rodeo Drive, Wilshire Boulevard, and within the Business Triangle may require Architectural Commission approval for exterior modifications visible from the public right-of-way.
- **Enhanced seismic standards** — Beverly Hills has adopted local amendments that may require more conservative seismic design parameters than the base CBC for certain building types.
- **Historic preservation overlay** — Properties within the Beverly Hills Historic District or individually designated landmarks require approval from the Cultural Heritage Commission before structural modifications proceed.
- **Parking structure requirements** — TI projects that change occupancy type or increase occupancy load may trigger additional parking requirements, which can involve structural modifications to existing parking structures.

### Seismic Design Requirements

Beverly Hills commercial buildings must comply with ASCE 7-22 seismic design parameters specific to the city's location:

- **Site Class D (default)** — Stiff soil conditions typical of the Beverly Hills alluvial plain
- **Mapped spectral acceleration values** — Ss = 2.35g, S1 = 0.92g (approximate values; site-specific geotechnical investigation may be required)
- **Risk Category III** — For buildings with occupancy loads exceeding 300 persons, common in Beverly Hills commercial venues
- **Seismic Design Category D or E** — Requiring special detailing for all structural modifications

These parameters significantly affect the cost and complexity of structural modifications. A simple wall removal in a low-seismic zone might require a single steel beam, while the same removal in a Beverly Hills building may require a moment frame with special moment connections.

### Fire Rating Requirements

Beverly Hills commercial buildings frequently require fire-rated wall and floor assemblies:

- **1-hour fire-rated corridors** in office buildings
- **2-hour fire-rated occupancy separations** between commercial and residential uses in mixed-use buildings
- **2-hour fire-rated shaft enclosures** for stairways and elevator shafts
- **Fire-rated floor/ceiling assemblies** between floors in multi-story buildings

When TI work involves modifying fire-rated assemblies, the structural engineer must specify replacement assemblies that maintain the required fire rating while supporting the new structural loads.

## How Much Does Tenant Improvement Engineering Cost in Beverly Hills?

Engineering fees for Beverly Hills TI projects reflect the complexity of the commercial building stock, stringent code requirements, and the high-value nature of Beverly Hills commercial real estate.

| Project Type | Typical Fee Range | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Simple wall removal / opening (single element) | $5,000 - $8,000 | 2-3 weeks |
| Office TI with multiple wall modifications | $8,000 - $15,000 | 3-5 weeks |
| Restaurant build-out (full kitchen, bar, mezzanine) | $12,000 - $22,000 | 4-6 weeks |
| Retail flagship store (Rodeo Drive, custom structural features) | $15,000 - $28,000 | 5-8 weeks |
| Multi-floor office consolidation with new stair/elevator | $18,000 - $30,000 | 6-10 weeks |
| Medical/dental office with imaging equipment | $10,000 - $20,000 | 4-6 weeks |
| Subterranean-level build-out (basement renovation) | $12,000 - $25,000 | 5-8 weeks |
| Seismic retrofit triggered by TI scope | $15,000 - $35,000 | 6-12 weeks |

### Factors That Influence Beverly Hills TI Engineering Costs

**Building age and type.** Pre-1970 unreinforced masonry buildings require more investigation and more complex engineering than modern steel-frame or concrete structures. Beverly Hills has significant inventory of older commercial buildings, particularly south of Wilshire Boulevard.

**Availability of original drawings.** When original structural drawings are available, engineering costs decrease by 15-25% because the existing conditions investigation is streamlined. The Beverly Hills Building & Safety Division maintains records for many commercial properties.

**Seismic upgrade triggers.** If your TI project triggers a mandatory seismic evaluation, budget an additional $10,000-$25,000 for seismic analysis and retrofit design.

**Subterranean conditions.** Beverly Hills commercial buildings with basements and subterranean parking require additional engineering attention for underpinning, shoring design, and waterproofing coordination during TI renovations.

**Historic designation.** Properties under historic preservation overlay require additional documentation, analysis of existing historic structural elements, and design solutions that preserve character-defining features.

## What Are Common Challenges in Beverly Hills Commercial Renovations?

Beverly Hills commercial TI projects present challenges that differ from standard commercial renovations in other Southern California markets.

### Historic and Legacy Building Stock

Beverly Hills contains numerous commercial buildings from the 1920s through 1960s that feature unreinforced masonry walls, non-ductile concrete frames, and structural systems that predate modern seismic codes. Tenant improvements in these buildings require:

- Comprehensive existing conditions investigation (often without original drawings)
- Creative structural solutions that work within the constraints of the existing system
- Seismic strengthening that may be triggered by the scope of modifications
- Coordination with the Beverly Hills Cultural Heritage Commission for designated properties

Our engineers have extensive experience with pre-1970 commercial buildings throughout the Los Angeles region and understand how to design efficient structural modifications within these constraints.

### Subterranean and Basement-Level Work

Many Beverly Hills commercial properties include basement and sub-basement levels used for storage, parking, mechanical rooms, and back-of-house operations. Converting these subterranean spaces to occupied commercial use involves:

- **Structural slab evaluation** — Determining whether existing floor slabs above can support new occupancy loads
- **Waterproofing coordination** — Ensuring structural modifications do not compromise below-grade waterproofing systems
- **Shoring design** — Temporary shoring calculations for work that reduces structural capacity during construction
- **Underpinning analysis** — Evaluating foundation impacts when excavating or modifying below-grade spaces
- **Egress compliance** — Structural design for new stairways and exit corridors from subterranean levels

The high water table in certain areas of Beverly Hills adds complexity to subterranean structural work, requiring hydrostatic pressure analysis and coordination with geotechnical engineers.

### Luxury Finish Integration

Beverly Hills commercial tenants install premium finishes — stone cladding, custom metalwork, large-format glass installations, and sculptural design elements — that impose significant structural loads. Our engineering accounts for:

- **Stone facade loads** — Marble and granite cladding systems weighing 15-25 pounds per square foot requiring structural backing and anchorage design
- **Oversized glass installations** — Full-height glass walls and storefronts requiring structural steel frames designed for wind loads and seismic drift limits
- **Cantilevered features** — Floating staircases, suspended displays, and cantilevered balconies requiring precise structural analysis
- **Heavy ceiling installations** — Custom ceiling designs weighing 5-15 pounds per square foot requiring supplemental framing

### High-Rise Considerations

Beverly Hills and the adjacent Century City corridor include commercial high-rise buildings where TI work presents unique structural challenges:

- **Core wall modifications** — Any penetrations through shear walls or core walls require careful engineering to maintain lateral system integrity
- **Post-tensioned slab coordination** — Many high-rise buildings use post-tensioned concrete slabs where cutting or coring requires tendon mapping and engineering approval
- **Column transfer considerations** — Modifications near column transfer zones require analysis of load path continuity
- **Wind and seismic drift** — Interior partition design must accommodate inter-story drift without damage

### Adjacent Tenant Coordination

Beverly Hills commercial properties, particularly multi-tenant buildings, require structural work that does not adversely affect adjacent tenants. Our engineering addresses:

- Vibration analysis and mitigation during construction
- Structural isolation between tenant spaces
- Temporary shoring that maintains building stability during construction
- Noise and vibration control specifications for sensitive adjacent uses

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get a structural engineering permit for a TI project in Beverly Hills?

The Beverly Hills Community Development Department processes standard commercial TI plan checks in 4-6 weeks. Expedited review is available for 2-3 weeks with an additional city fee. Our structural plans typically require 2-4 weeks to prepare before submission, making the total timeline from engagement to permit 6-10 weeks for standard projects.

### Do I need a structural engineer for a simple wall removal in my Beverly Hills commercial space?

Yes, if the wall is load-bearing or part of the lateral force-resisting system. Beverly Hills requires PE-stamped structural plans for any modification that affects the building's structural system. Even walls that appear non-structural may carry loads in older Beverly Hills buildings. We recommend a preliminary assessment ($500-$1,000) to determine whether structural engineering is required before committing to a full design scope.

### Can I use the same structural engineer for projects in Beverly Hills and other LA-area cities?

Absolutely. AAA Engineering & Design is licensed throughout California and regularly handles projects in Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Century City, Bel Air, and across the greater Los Angeles region. Using the same firm across multiple projects provides consistency in quality and communication.

### What happens if my Beverly Hills TI project triggers a seismic retrofit requirement?

When a TI project triggers seismic upgrade requirements, the structural engineer evaluates the entire building's seismic performance and designs strengthening measures. This can add $15,000-$35,000 in engineering fees and 6-12 weeks to the project timeline. However, early identification of seismic triggers during the assessment phase allows you to negotiate responsibility with your landlord before construction begins.

### How do I know if my Beverly Hills commercial building has structural drawings on file?

Contact the Beverly Hills Community Development Department at 455 North Rexford Drive to request a records search for your property. The city maintains building permit records that may include original structural drawings. AAA Engineering can also conduct this records search on your behalf as part of our assessment phase.

### Does AAA Engineering Design handle the permit submission process in Beverly Hills?

We prepare all structural plans, calculations, and specifications in the format the Beverly Hills Building & Safety Division requires. We coordinate with the project architect for permit application submission and respond to all structural plan check comments directly with the city examiner.

### What is the difference between a structural engineer and an architect for TI work?

An architect designs the space layout, finishes, and overall building design. A structural engineer designs the structural modifications that make the architectural vision possible — beams to replace removed walls, columns to support new mezzanines, connections to transfer loads safely, and seismic upgrades. Both disciplines are required for most Beverly Hills commercial TI projects, and their work must be coordinated for successful permitting.

### How much does a preliminary structural assessment cost for a Beverly Hills commercial space?

A preliminary structural assessment, including a site visit and written report on structural feasibility and estimated engineering costs, ranges from $500 to $1,500 depending on the building complexity and project scope. This assessment is credited toward full engineering services if you proceed with the project.
