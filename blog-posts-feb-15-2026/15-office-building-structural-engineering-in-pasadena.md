## What Is Office Building Structural Engineering?

Office building structural engineering is the branch of structural engineering focused on the design, analysis, and certification of structural systems that support commercial office buildings. An office building structural engineer Pasadena property owners rely on provides three core categories of service:

### New Construction Design

New office building construction in Pasadena requires structural engineering from the earliest conceptual stages. The structural engineer designs the foundation system, vertical load-carrying elements (columns, bearing walls, shear walls), horizontal framing systems (beams, girders, floor diaphragms), and the lateral force-resisting system. For Pasadena's market, this frequently involves steel moment frame or braced frame systems for mid-rise buildings and wood or light-gauge steel framing for smaller structures.

### Renovation and Tenant Improvement

Existing office buildings in Pasadena regularly undergo renovation to accommodate new tenants or update building systems. Structural engineering is required whenever renovations involve removing load-bearing walls, creating new floor openings, adding mezzanine levels, reinforcing floors for heavy equipment, or modifying the lateral system. The Pasadena Building & Safety Division requires PE-stamped structural plans for all renovation work that affects structural integrity.

### Seismic Upgrade and Retrofit

Pasadena's proximity to the Sierra Madre and Raymond faults places the city in a high seismic hazard zone. Many office buildings constructed before 1975 do not meet current seismic standards. [Seismic retrofitting](/services/seismic-retrofitting) brings these structures up to current California Building Code requirements, protecting occupants and preserving the building owner's investment. This is particularly critical for URM buildings in Old Pasadena and the Playhouse District.

---

## What Types of Office Building Projects Are Common in Pasadena?

Pasadena's commercial office market generates a wide range of structural engineering needs. The city's unique combination of historic building stock, active development zones, and stringent preservation requirements creates project types that differ substantially from those in newer Southern California cities like Irvine or Ontario.

### Historic Office Building Renovation

Pasadena contains one of the densest concentrations of historically significant commercial buildings in Los Angeles County. The Old Pasadena Historic District alone includes dozens of commercial buildings dating from the 1890s through the 1930s, many of which now serve as office space. These buildings require structural engineering that respects original construction methods while meeting current code requirements. Common challenges include unreinforced brick masonry walls, inadequate floor diaphragm connections, deteriorated wood framing, and foundation systems that predate modern seismic design standards.

Projects in this category typically range from $25,000 to $80,000 in structural engineering fees, depending on building size and complexity. The structural engineer must coordinate with the Pasadena Design Commission and, in many cases, the California State Historic Preservation Office.

### Mid-Rise New Construction

Pasadena continues to approve new mid-rise office and mixed-use developments, particularly along the Colorado Boulevard corridor, the South Lake Avenue business district, and near the Gold Line transit stations. New office buildings in Pasadena typically range from 3 to 8 stories and incorporate Type I or Type II construction with steel or concrete structural systems. The structural engineer designs these buildings to meet the most current edition of the California Building Code, including the enhanced seismic design requirements applicable to Pasadena's Seismic Design Category D designation.

Engineering fees for new mid-rise construction typically range from $30,000 to $80,000, depending on the building's size, structural system, and soil conditions. Pasadena's variable soil profiles, including areas of alluvial deposits near the Arroyo Seco and harder formations near the foothills, require site-specific geotechnical analysis that the structural engineer must integrate into the foundation design.

### Adaptive Reuse Conversions

Pasadena has embraced adaptive reuse as a development strategy, converting older commercial and industrial buildings into modern office space. Former bank buildings, department stores, auto dealerships, and light industrial structures have all been converted to office use in the Pasadena market. These conversions require structural engineering to evaluate the existing building's capacity for its new use, design reinforcement where needed, and ensure compliance with current seismic and accessibility standards.

Adaptive reuse projects in Pasadena frequently involve adding new floor openings for atriums or internal stairs, reinforcing floors for increased occupancy loads, modifying exterior walls for new window openings, and adding seismic strengthening to meet current code requirements. Engineering fees typically range from $15,000 to $60,000.

### Seismic Retrofit of Unreinforced Masonry Office Buildings

Pasadena's URM ordinance requires the seismic retrofit of unreinforced masonry buildings within the city. Many of these buildings serve as office space, particularly in Old Pasadena and the Playhouse District. The structural engineer designs retrofit solutions that may include steel moment frames inserted within the existing structure, shotcrete shear walls applied to existing masonry, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapping of masonry piers, and improved connections between walls and floor or roof diaphragms.

URM retrofit engineering fees typically range from $15,000 to $50,000, with construction costs varying widely based on the building's size and condition.

## How Does the Office Building Engineering Process Work?

The structural engineering process for Pasadena office buildings follows a systematic approach that aligns with the city's permitting requirements and the California Building Code.

### Phase 1: Structural Assessment and Feasibility

Every office building project begins with a thorough structural assessment. For existing buildings, the structural engineer conducts a site visit to evaluate the building's current structural condition, identify the structural system type, document any damage or deterioration, and determine the building's capacity relative to the proposed modifications. For new construction, this phase involves reviewing the geotechnical report, evaluating the architectural concept, and confirming structural feasibility.

**Deliverables:** Structural assessment report, feasibility opinion, preliminary cost estimate for structural work.

**Timeline:** 1 to 2 weeks.

**Cost:** $1,500 to $5,000, depending on building size and complexity.

### Phase 2: Structural Design and Engineering

During the design phase, the structural engineer develops the complete structural solution. This includes performing structural calculations, developing structural drawings, specifying materials and connection details, and coordinating with the architect, mechanical engineer, and other project consultants. For seismic retrofit projects, this phase includes the ASCE 41 evaluation and the design of the retrofit scheme.

The structural design must comply with the California Building Code (currently the 2022 CBC), the Pasadena Municipal Code, and any applicable historic preservation standards. For buildings in the Old Pasadena Historic District or other designated areas, the structural engineer coordinates with the architect to ensure that structural modifications do not compromise historically significant features.

**Deliverables:** PE-stamped structural calculations, structural plan set, structural specifications.

**Timeline:** 3 to 8 weeks, depending on project complexity.

**Cost:** $8,000 to $60,000.

### Phase 3: Permitting and Plan Check

The structural plans are submitted to the Pasadena Building & Safety Division for plan check. Pasadena's plan check process for commercial office projects typically takes 4 to 8 weeks for the initial review, with potential resubmittal cycles adding 2 to 4 weeks each. The structural engineer responds to plan check comments and revises plans as needed to obtain approval.

For projects in historic districts or involving designated landmarks, the plans must also receive approval from the Pasadena Design Commission before the building permit is issued. This adds an additional layer of review that the structural engineer must anticipate in the project schedule.

**Deliverables:** Plan check response letters, revised structural plans, permit-ready documents.

**Timeline:** 4 to 12 weeks.

**Cost:** $1,500 to $5,000 for plan check response support.

### Phase 4: Construction Support and Observation

During construction, the structural engineer provides observation services to verify work matches approved plans. This includes reviewing shop drawings, visiting the site at critical milestones, addressing field conditions requiring design modifications, and issuing compliance reports. Pasadena requires special inspection for concrete placement, steel welding, and masonry construction.

**Deliverables:** Inspection reports, field observation letters, as-built documentation.

**Timeline:** Throughout construction.

**Cost:** $3,000 to $10,000.

## What Are Pasadena's Specific Building Code Requirements for Office Structures?

Pasadena enforces the California Building Code with local amendments that add specific requirements for commercial office buildings. Understanding these requirements before starting a project prevents costly redesigns and permitting delays.

### Seismic Design Requirements

Pasadena sits in Seismic Design Category D under the current CBC, reflecting the city's proximity to the Sierra Madre Fault and the Raymond Fault. These are active thrust faults capable of producing earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 to 7.5. The structural engineer must design office buildings to resist the seismic forces specified for this category, which are among the highest in the building code.

Key seismic design requirements for Pasadena office buildings include:

- **Lateral force-resisting system selection** — Steel moment frames, braced frames, concrete shear walls, or combinations must meet the ductility and redundancy requirements of CBC Chapter 16 and ASCE 7.
- **Foundation design** — Foundations must resist both gravity loads and seismic overturning moments. In Pasadena's variable soil conditions, this frequently requires deepened footings, grade beams, or mat foundations.
- **Diaphragm design** — Floor and roof diaphragms must transfer lateral forces to the vertical elements of the lateral system. For older buildings, diaphragm deficiencies are a primary source of seismic vulnerability.
- **Drift limits** — The building's story drift under design-level seismic forces must remain within code limits to protect nonstructural components and ensure life safety.

### Pasadena Building & Safety Division Requirements

The Pasadena Building & Safety Division, located at 175 North Garfield Avenue, administers the permitting process for all commercial construction in the city. Key procedural requirements for office building projects include:

- **Pre-application conference** — Recommended for major projects. Allows the project team to discuss scope, code requirements, and process with plan check staff before submitting.
- **Structural peer review** — Required for buildings over 160 feet in height or those using alternative structural systems not prescriptively addressed in the code.
- **Soils report** — A geotechnical investigation is required for all new construction and for existing buildings where structural modifications affect the foundation.
- **Special inspection program** — The building owner must engage a special inspection agency to verify critical structural construction, including concrete, structural steel, masonry, and wood shear walls.

### Historic Preservation Requirements

Pasadena's historic preservation program adds structural engineering requirements for office buildings in designated historic districts or individually designated landmarks. The Design Commission reviews exterior modifications, and the city's Cultural Heritage Commission may be involved for designated landmarks.

Structural work on historic office buildings must follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This means the structural engineer must design solutions that:

- Preserve character-defining features of the building
- Minimize damage to historic materials
- Use reversible interventions where possible
- Maintain the building's historic appearance from the public right-of-way

For URM buildings in Pasadena, the city's mandatory retrofit ordinance requires owners to bring the building's seismic performance up to a minimum standard. The structural engineer designs the retrofit to satisfy both the seismic performance requirements and the historic preservation standards, which sometimes creates design conflicts that require creative engineering solutions.

### Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Ordinance

Pasadena's URM ordinance identifies unreinforced masonry buildings and requires their owners to seismically strengthen them. Many of these buildings are located in Old Pasadena, along Colorado Boulevard, and in the Playhouse District. The ordinance establishes a compliance timeline and minimum retrofit standards that the structural engineer must meet.

Common URM retrofit strategies for Pasadena office buildings include:

| Retrofit Method | Description | Typical Cost per SF |
|---|---|---|
| Steel moment frame insertion | New steel frames installed within existing structure | $25 - $45 |
| Shotcrete shear walls | Reinforced concrete applied to interior face of masonry walls | $15 - $30 |
| FRP wrapping | Fiber-reinforced polymer applied to masonry piers and walls | $10 - $25 |
| Roof/floor diaphragm strengthening | Plywood overlay or steel bracing added to existing diaphragms | $8 - $18 |
| Wall-to-diaphragm anchoring | New anchors connecting masonry walls to floor and roof framing | $5 - $12 |

## How Much Does Office Building Structural Engineering Cost in Pasadena?

Structural engineering costs for office building projects in Pasadena vary significantly based on project type, building size, structural complexity, and whether the building has historic designation. The following table provides cost ranges based on our experience with Pasadena commercial projects:

| Project Type | Building Size | Engineering Fee Range | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tenant improvement (single suite) | 1,000 - 5,000 SF | $3,000 - $8,000 | 2-4 weeks |
| Tenant improvement (full floor) | 5,000 - 20,000 SF | $6,000 - $15,000 | 3-6 weeks |
| Seismic evaluation (ASCE 41) | Any size | $5,000 - $20,000 | 3-6 weeks |
| URM seismic retrofit | 5,000 - 30,000 SF | $15,000 - $50,000 | 6-16 weeks |
| Historic building renovation | 5,000 - 50,000 SF | $20,000 - $65,000 | 8-20 weeks |
| Adaptive reuse conversion | 10,000 - 50,000 SF | $15,000 - $60,000 | 8-16 weeks |
| New construction (mid-rise) | 20,000 - 100,000 SF | $30,000 - $80,000 | 10-24 weeks |
| New construction (low-rise) | 5,000 - 20,000 SF | $10,000 - $30,000 | 6-12 weeks |

### Factors That Drive Engineering Costs in Pasadena

Several factors specific to Pasadena tend to increase structural engineering costs compared to other Southern California cities:

1. **Historic preservation compliance** — Designated historic buildings require additional documentation, Design Commission coordination, and preservation-sensitive design solutions. This adds 15% to 30% to engineering fees.

2. **Seismic hazard level** — Proximity to the Sierra Madre and Raymond faults results in higher seismic design forces than many parts of Los Angeles County.

3. **Soil conditions** — Variable soil profiles, from alluvial deposits near the Arroyo Seco to denser formations near the San Gabriel foothills, require site-specific foundation design.

4. **Building age and condition** — Many Pasadena office buildings are 50 to 100+ years old, requiring more extensive investigation and complex engineering solutions.

5. **Plan check duration** — Pasadena's plan check process can take longer than neighboring cities like Glendale or Arcadia, increasing overall project timelines.

## What Historic Preservation Challenges Affect Pasadena Office Buildings?

Pasadena's commitment to historic preservation creates structural engineering challenges that are uncommon in other Southern California markets. Understanding these challenges upfront helps building owners and developers plan their projects accurately.

### Unreinforced Masonry Building Retrofit

URM buildings represent the most structurally challenging category of historic office buildings in Pasadena. These buildings, constructed primarily between 1890 and 1933, use unreinforced brick or stone masonry bearing walls that are inherently vulnerable to seismic forces. The structural engineer must design a retrofit system that provides adequate seismic resistance while preserving the building's historic character.

The challenge is balancing structural performance with preservation. Adding shotcrete to a brick wall is structurally effective but changes the interior appearance. Installing a steel moment frame preserves masonry walls but reduces usable floor area. FRP wrapping preserves both appearance and floor area but may not provide sufficient strength for larger buildings. The structural engineer evaluates each building to determine the optimal combination of techniques.

### Historic Facade Preservation

Many Pasadena office buildings feature architecturally significant facades that the Design Commission requires to be preserved. When the structural system requires modification, the structural engineer designs temporary and permanent support systems that keep the historic facade intact. These projects require careful analysis of facade stability during construction and permanent connections integrating the facade with the new structural system.

### Adaptive Reuse Structural Requirements

Converting a non-office building to office use in Pasadena triggers a change-of-occupancy analysis under the CBC. The structural engineer evaluates whether the existing structural system is adequate for new office occupancy loads and seismic requirements. In many cases, the change of occupancy requires seismic upgrades not triggered by same-occupancy renovations.

Buildings in neighboring South Pasadena and Altadena face similar historic preservation challenges, though the regulatory framework differs. Property owners in Glendale and Arcadia also benefit from understanding Pasadena's approach as regional preservation trends expand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does every office building project in Pasadena require a structural engineer?

Any project that modifies a building's structural system requires a licensed structural engineer or civil engineer. In Pasadena, this includes removing or modifying load-bearing walls, creating new openings, adding floors or mezzanines, changing the building's occupancy type, and performing seismic retrofits. The Pasadena Building & Safety Division requires PE-stamped structural plans for these modifications.

### How long does it take to get a structural permit in Pasadena for office work?

Pasadena's plan check timeline for commercial office projects typically runs 4 to 8 weeks for the initial review. Projects involving historic buildings or Design Commission review add 4 to 8 additional weeks. Total permitting timelines from submission to permit issuance range from 6 to 16 weeks, depending on project complexity and the number of plan check cycles required.

### What is an ASCE 41 seismic evaluation, and does my Pasadena office building need one?

An ASCE 41 evaluation is a standardized method for assessing an existing building's seismic performance. It identifies structural deficiencies and determines the level of seismic retrofit needed to achieve a target performance objective. Pasadena office buildings constructed before 1975 are strong candidates for ASCE 41 evaluations, particularly URM buildings subject to the city's mandatory retrofit ordinance.

### How does the Pasadena Design Commission affect structural engineering for historic office buildings?

The Design Commission reviews exterior modifications to buildings in historic districts and individually designated landmarks. Structural modifications that affect the building's exterior appearance, such as adding shear walls visible from outside, modifying window openings, or installing exterior bracing, require Design Commission approval. The structural engineer must coordinate with the architect to present solutions that satisfy both structural and preservation requirements.

### Can I remove load-bearing walls in my Pasadena office building?

Load-bearing walls in Pasadena office buildings can be removed with proper structural engineering. The structural engineer designs a beam and column system or other structural element to carry the loads previously supported by the wall. This requires PE-stamped calculations and drawings, and the work must be permitted through the Pasadena Building & Safety Division. In historic buildings, additional review by the Design Commission may be required.

### What seismic faults affect Pasadena office buildings?

Pasadena is located near two significant active faults: the Sierra Madre Fault, which runs along the base of the San Gabriel Mountains north of the city, and the Raymond Fault, which passes through the southern portion of Pasadena. Both are capable of producing strong ground shaking. The structural engineer accounts for these seismic sources when designing new buildings or evaluating existing structures.

### Do tenant improvements in Pasadena office buildings always need structural engineering?

Not all tenant improvements require structural engineering. Cosmetic renovations such as painting, carpet replacement, and cabinet installation typically do not. However, any modification that affects the building's structural system requires a structural engineer. This includes removing walls, creating new openings, adding heavy equipment, installing mezzanines, or modifying the roof structure. When in doubt, consult with a structural engineer before starting work.

### How do soil conditions in Pasadena affect office building foundations?

Pasadena's soil conditions vary across the city. Areas near the Arroyo Seco contain alluvial deposits susceptible to settlement or liquefaction during earthquakes. Areas closer to the San Gabriel foothills have denser soils with better bearing capacity. A geotechnical investigation is required for all new construction and recommended for major renovations. The structural engineer uses the geotechnical data to design foundations appropriate for the site.
