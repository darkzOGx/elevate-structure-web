## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I find a good seismic retrofit engineer near me in Riverside?

Look for California PE-licensed engineers with seismic retrofit specialization, older home construction knowledge, local building department experience, and clear communication. Verify licenses at bpelsg.ca.gov. AAA Engineering Design specializes in Riverside seismic retrofits with 20+ years of experience.

### Does my Riverside home need seismic retrofit?

Homes built before 1980 on raised foundations are prime candidates for seismic retrofit. Signs you may need retrofit include: no visible foundation bolts, short cripple walls without bracing, or living near active faults like the San Jacinto. We provide free assessments to determine your needs.

### How much does seismic retrofit engineering cost in Riverside?

Seismic retrofit engineering in Riverside typically costs $2,000-$5,000 depending on retrofit scope. Foundation bolting plans range $2,000-$3,000; comprehensive retrofits with cripple wall bracing cost $3,500-$5,000. We provide free written quotes.

### How long does seismic retrofit engineering take?

Seismic retrofit engineering typically takes 2-3 weeks for standard projects. Complex retrofits or homes requiring additional assessment may take 3-4 weeks. This is engineering time only; construction and permits are additional.

### What is foundation bolting?

Foundation bolting secures your home's wood frame to its concrete foundation using anchor bolts and metal connectors. Without proper bolting, your house can slide off its foundation during an earthquake. Retrofitting adds modern bolting to homes built before this was required.

### Will seismic retrofit increase my home value?

Yes, seismic retrofit can increase home value and marketability, especially in earthquake-prone Riverside. Many buyers and lenders specifically look for retrofit documentation. The investment in safety also provides peace of mind and may reduce earthquake insurance premiums.
