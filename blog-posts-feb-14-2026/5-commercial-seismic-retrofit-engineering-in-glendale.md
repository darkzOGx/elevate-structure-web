# Commercial Seismic Retrofit Engineering in Glendale: Complete 2026 Guide

**Updated: February 2026**

<div data-speakable="true">

**Answer Capsule:** Commercial seismic retrofit engineering in Glendale upgrades existing commercial buildings to resist earthquake forces through steel moment frames, concrete shear walls, foundation strengthening, and soft-story reinforcement. AAA Engineering Design provides licensed PE-stamped retrofit designs for Glendale commercial buildings with engineering fees ranging from $12,000 to $120,000 based on building size and retrofit scope.

</div>

Glendale faces significant seismic risk from the Raymond Fault, the Sierra Madre Fault, and the nearby San Andreas Fault system, making commercial seismic retrofit engineering an urgent priority for building owners throughout the city. With over 4,500 commercial buildings in Glendale predating modern seismic codes, and the City of Glendale actively enforcing mandatory retrofit ordinances for vulnerable building types, demand for qualified commercial seismic retrofit engineering continues to grow in 2026. AAA Engineering Design provides California PE-licensed seismic retrofit engineering services backed by 20+ years of experience and 500+ completed projects across Southern California, delivering structural upgrade designs that protect lives, preserve property values, and satisfy Glendale Building & Safety Division requirements.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused over $200 million in damage to Glendale buildings, exposing critical structural vulnerabilities in the city's commercial building stock. Since then, Glendale has adopted progressive retrofit ordinances targeting unreinforced masonry buildings, soft-story structures, and non-ductile concrete frame buildings. Commercial building owners in Glendale who have not yet completed required seismic retrofits face code enforcement actions, insurance coverage limitations, and potential liability exposure. This comprehensive guide covers every aspect of commercial seismic retrofit engineering in Glendale.

## What Is Commercial Seismic Retrofit Engineering?

Commercial seismic retrofit engineering is the structural engineering discipline of evaluating existing commercial buildings for earthquake vulnerability and designing structural modifications that bring the building's seismic performance to an acceptable level. Unlike new construction designed to current code standards, seismic retrofit engineering works within the constraints of existing structures, requiring creative solutions that strengthen the building while minimizing disruption to tenants and operations.

The retrofit engineer's scope includes:

- **Seismic evaluation**: Assessing the existing building's structural system, identifying deficiencies, and quantifying the expected performance during design-level earthquakes
- **Retrofit strategy selection**: Choosing the most appropriate structural upgrade approach from multiple options including strength enhancement, stiffness modification, and ductility improvement
- **Structural design**: Engineering the new structural elements (frames, walls, foundations) and their connections to the existing building
- **Construction documents**: Producing permit-ready drawings and specifications for the retrofit construction
- **Construction administration**: Overseeing the retrofit installation to verify compliance with the design intent

In Glendale, commercial seismic retrofit engineering addresses several distinct building vulnerability categories, each requiring specialized engineering approaches. The city's building stock spans over a century of construction, from early 1900s unreinforced masonry commercial blocks downtown to 1970s non-ductile concrete office buildings along Brand Boulevard and 1980s tilt-up industrial buildings in the Grand Central Business District.

Our [seismic retrofitting services](/services/seismic-retrofitting) provide comprehensive retrofit engineering for all commercial building types in Glendale and throughout Los Angeles County.

## How Do Steel Moment Frames Strengthen Glendale Commercial Buildings?

Steel moment frames represent the most versatile and widely used seismic retrofit system for Glendale commercial buildings. These frames provide lateral force resistance through rigid beam-to-column connections that develop bending resistance (moments) at the joints, allowing the frame to resist earthquake forces without diagonal braces that would block doorways, windows, or tenant spaces.

### Types of Steel Moment Frames for Retrofit

Glendale commercial retrofit projects use three primary moment frame configurations:

**Special Moment Frames (SMF)**
- Highest ductility and energy dissipation capacity
- R = 8.0, allowing the greatest reduction in design seismic forces
- Requires prequalified connections per AISC 358 (Reduced Beam Section, BFP, WUF-W)
- Used for significant retrofits where maximum seismic performance is required
- Most common for large Glendale commercial buildings and essential facilities

**Intermediate Moment Frames (IMF)**
- Moderate ductility with simpler connection detailing
- R = 4.5, intermediate force reduction
- Suitable for low-rise Glendale commercial buildings (1-3 stories) where drift limits are easily met
- Lower fabrication cost than SMF connections

**Ordinary Moment Frames (OMF)**
- Limited to specific applications in Seismic Design Category D per ASCE 7-22 exceptions
- R = 3.5, minimal force reduction
- Used for light-frame commercial buildings and single-story structures in Glendale where other systems are impractical

### Moment Frame Installation Process

Installing steel moment frames in existing Glendale commercial buildings follows a carefully sequenced process:

1. **Foundation assessment**: Evaluate existing foundations for capacity to resist frame overturning forces; design new micro-piles, drilled shafts, or foundation enlargements as needed
2. **Selective demolition**: Remove portions of existing walls, floors, and finishes to expose the structural frame and create openings for new steel members
3. **Steel erection**: Install columns, beams, and connection hardware using crane or hand-set methods depending on site access and building configuration
4. **Connection completion**: Execute field welding or bolting of moment connections under continuous special inspection
5. **Foundation construction**: Install new foundations or foundation modifications to support frame forces
6. **Integration**: Connect new steel frames to the existing building's diaphragms and vertical elements to create a complete lateral system
7. **Restoration**: Rebuild architectural finishes, fire-rated assemblies, and building systems disturbed by the retrofit construction

AAA Engineering Design has designed steel moment frame retrofits for commercial buildings throughout Glendale, including multi-story office buildings on Brand Boulevard, retail buildings in the Americana area, and mixed-use structures in downtown Glendale.

## What Is Soft-Story Commercial Retrofit in Glendale?

Soft-story commercial buildings in Glendale feature a weak or flexible first story, typically caused by large storefront openings, parking areas at the ground level, or discontinuous shear walls. During earthquakes, the soft story concentrates lateral deformation, leading to partial or complete collapse of the ground floor while upper stories remain relatively intact.

### Glendale Soft-Story Retrofit Ordinance

The City of Glendale adopted a mandatory soft-story retrofit ordinance following the model established by the City of Los Angeles. The ordinance applies to:

- Wood-frame buildings with soft, weak, or open-front walls at the ground story
- Buildings with 3 or more stories
- Buildings with ground-floor commercial occupancy and residential units above
- Structures built prior to January 1, 1978

Building owners received compliance deadlines with penalties for non-compliance including restricted occupancy permits and potential vacate orders.

### Commercial Soft-Story Retrofit Methods

Structural engineers use several approaches to retrofit soft-story commercial buildings in Glendale:

**Steel Moment Frames at Ground Floor**
- Install steel moment frames within existing storefront openings
- Frames provide lateral resistance while maintaining commercial visibility and access
- Engineering fee: $15,000-$35,000 for typical 3-4 story commercial-over-residential buildings
- Construction cost: $50,000-$150,000 depending on building size and number of frames required

**Cantilever Columns with Steel Beams**
- Install steel columns anchored to new foundations, connected by steel beams at the first-floor level
- Creates a rigid base system beneath the existing upper-story structure
- Suitable for buildings where moment frames would excessively obstruct ground-floor openings

**Plywood Shear Walls**
- Add structural plywood sheathing to existing wood-framed walls at the ground floor
- Most economical retrofit option when wall locations are available
- Limited application in commercial ground floors where openings dominate

**Steel Brace Frames**
- Install diagonal steel braces within selected bays at the ground floor
- Highly effective but creates visual obstructions that limit ground-floor commercial flexibility
- Used where architectural constraints allow brace placement

### Case Study: Glendale Brand Boulevard Commercial Building

A three-story mixed-use building on Brand Boulevard in Glendale required soft-story retrofit to comply with the city's mandatory ordinance. The ground floor featured continuous storefront glazing with no significant lateral resistance. AAA Engineering Design designed a system of three special steel moment frames integrated into the storefront bays, maintaining commercial visibility while providing the required lateral strength. The retrofit was completed in 12 weeks with minimal tenant disruption, at a total construction cost of $125,000.

## How Are Unreinforced Masonry Commercial Buildings Retrofitted in Glendale?

Unreinforced masonry (URM) commercial buildings represent Glendale's most seismically vulnerable building type. These structures, built before 1934 when California first adopted seismic building codes, use brick or stone walls without steel reinforcement, creating buildings with virtually no ductility or tensile capacity under earthquake forces.

### Glendale URM Building Inventory

Glendale's URM building inventory includes approximately 120 commercial and mixed-use buildings, concentrated in:

- **Downtown Glendale**: Historic commercial blocks along Brand Boulevard and Broadway
- **Montrose Shopping Park**: Historic retail district with early 20th-century masonry buildings
- **Kenneth Road Commercial District**: Older commercial buildings near Glendale College
- **San Fernando Road Corridor**: Industrial and commercial masonry buildings dating to the 1920s-1940s

### URM Retrofit Engineering Approaches

Commercial URM retrofit engineering in Glendale follows California Historical Building Code (CHBC) and ASCE 41-17 guidelines:

**Wall Anchorage**
- Connect URM walls to floor and roof diaphragms using through-bolts and steel plates
- Prevents wall separation and out-of-plane wall collapse
- Required at every floor and roof level on all URM walls
- Engineering cost: $8,000-$15,000 for wall anchorage design alone

**Parapet Bracing**
- Reduce parapet heights or add steel bracing to prevent parapet collapse during earthquakes
- Parapets exceeding 1.5 times their thickness above the roof line require bracing per CBC requirements
- Critical life-safety measure for protecting pedestrians on Glendale sidewalks below

**Diaphragm Strengthening**
- Add plywood overlayment to existing wood diaphragms to increase in-plane shear capacity
- Install new steel cross-bracing beneath existing floors for enhanced diaphragm stiffness
- Design new drag struts and collectors to transfer diaphragm forces to lateral elements

**Shear Wall Addition**
- Install reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry shear walls at strategic locations within the building
- Shotcrete overlays on existing URM walls to add reinforcement and increase shear capacity
- Steel plate shear walls for maximum strength within minimal wall thickness

**Foundation Strengthening**
- Underpin existing shallow foundations to increase bearing capacity and resist overturning
- Install micro-piles or helical piles beneath existing footings to resist seismic uplift forces
- Add grade beams connecting isolated footings into a unified foundation system

Seismic retrofit engineering fees for Glendale commercial buildings vary significantly based on building type, size, and the scope of structural modifications required:

| Building Type | Engineering Fee Range | Construction Cost Range |
|---|---|---|
| Soft-story retrofit (wood frame, 3-4 story) | $12,000 - $35,000 | $50,000 - $200,000 |
| URM wall anchorage and parapet (small building) | $15,000 - $25,000 | $40,000 - $120,000 |
| URM comprehensive retrofit (medium building) | $25,000 - $55,000 | $150,000 - $500,000 |
| Non-ductile concrete frame retrofit | $35,000 - $75,000 | $200,000 - $800,000 |
| Large commercial building full retrofit | $75,000 - $120,000 | $500,000 - $2,000,000+ |
| Steel moment frame addition (per frame) | $8,000 - $15,000 | $25,000 - $60,000 |

Total project costs including engineering, permits, and construction for a typical Glendale commercial seismic retrofit range from $15 to $45 per square foot of building area. Tax benefits under IRC Section 179 and California retrofit incentive programs offset a portion of these costs for qualifying commercial buildings.

## What Building Codes and Regulations Govern Glendale Seismic Retrofits?

### Glendale Retrofit Ordinances

The City of Glendale has adopted multiple mandatory seismic retrofit ordinances:

- **URM Building Ordinance**: Requires seismic retrofit of all unreinforced masonry buildings within prescribed timelines, with compliance priorities based on occupancy type and building size
- **Soft-Story Retrofit Ordinance**: Mandates structural strengthening of soft-story wood-frame buildings meeting specific vulnerability criteria
- **Non-Ductile Concrete Ordinance**: Emerging requirements for evaluation and potential retrofit of concrete buildings designed before ductile detailing requirements (pre-1976)

### Engineering Standards for Retrofit

Glendale commercial seismic retrofits follow several engineering standards depending on the building type and retrofit objective:

- **ASCE 41-17**: Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings - the primary standard for performance-based retrofit design
- **CBC Chapter 34**: Existing buildings requirements, including triggers for structural upgrade and permitted retrofit approaches
- **CHBC (California Historical Building Code)**: Alternative compliance path for historically significant Glendale buildings
- **IEBC (International Existing Building Code)**: Referenced for alteration, repair, and change-of-occupancy requirements
- **AISC 341 and AISC 358**: Seismic design and prequalified connection standards for steel moment frame retrofits
- **ACI 318**: Concrete design requirements for new concrete elements added during retrofit

### Performance Objectives

Glendale commercial seismic retrofits target specific performance objectives per ASCE 41-17:

- **Life Safety (LS)**: Minimum acceptable performance for most commercial buildings; structural damage is expected but the building remains stable and occupants can safely exit
- **Immediate Occupancy (IO)**: Enhanced performance objective for essential facilities; the building remains functional after the design earthquake with minimal damage
- **Collapse Prevention (CP)**: Minimum code-prescribed performance for the maximum considered earthquake (MCE); the building does not collapse but sustains significant damage

Most Glendale commercial building owners target Life Safety performance for the BSE-1E earthquake (approximately 20% probability of exceedance in 50 years), which balances structural protection with retrofit cost.

### Permit Process

The Glendale commercial seismic retrofit permit process includes:

1. **Engineering evaluation**: Structural engineer assesses the existing building and identifies deficiencies
2. **Retrofit design**: Prepare structural retrofit drawings and calculations
3. **Plan submission**: Submit to Glendale Building & Safety Division
4. **Plan check review**: 4-8 weeks for standard review; expedited review available for mandatory compliance projects
5. **Corrections**: 2-4 weeks for correction response and re-review
6. **Permit issuance**: Upon approval, with construction timeline per ordinance requirements
7. **Construction inspections**: Special inspections for welding, concrete, and anchorage installations

## Geographic Considerations for Glendale Commercial Seismic Retrofit

### Glendale's Seismic Environment

Glendale sits within one of Southern California's most seismically active zones. The city's commercial building stock faces earthquake hazards from multiple fault sources:

- **Raymond Fault**: Active fault running through southern Glendale, capable of M6.5+ earthquakes
- **Sierra Madre Fault**: Active thrust fault along the San Gabriel Mountains north of Glendale, capable of M7.0+ earthquakes
- **Verdugo Fault**: Runs along the western edge of the Verdugo Mountains through central Glendale
- **Hollywood Fault**: Active fault south of Glendale affecting the Los Feliz and Hollywood border areas
- **San Andreas Fault**: 35 miles northeast, capable of M8.0+ earthquakes producing severe shaking in Glendale

This multi-fault seismic environment creates ground-shaking intensities in Glendale that rank among the highest in urban California. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis shows Glendale commercial buildings face peak ground accelerations of 0.5-0.8g during design-level earthquakes, with near-fault pulse effects from the Raymond and Verdugo Faults amplifying demands on certain building types.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my Glendale commercial building required to undergo seismic retrofit?

Glendale has adopted mandatory seismic retrofit ordinances for unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings and soft-story wood-frame buildings. Non-ductile concrete buildings face emerging evaluation requirements. Additionally, any change of occupancy, significant alteration, or addition to an existing Glendale commercial building triggers a seismic evaluation that determines whether retrofit is required. Contact Glendale Building & Safety or AAA Engineering Design at (949) 981-4448 to determine your building's compliance status.

### How long does a commercial seismic retrofit take in Glendale?

A typical Glendale commercial seismic retrofit takes 6-18 months from initial evaluation through construction completion. Engineering design requires 6-12 weeks, plan check takes 4-8 weeks, and construction ranges from 3-12 months depending on building size and retrofit scope. Soft-story retrofits of small commercial buildings complete in 3-4 months of construction. Comprehensive URM or non-ductile concrete retrofits of large buildings require 8-12 months of construction.

### How much does it cost to seismically retrofit a commercial building in Glendale?

Total retrofit costs for Glendale commercial buildings range from $15 to $45 per square foot of building area, including engineering, permits, and construction. A 10,000 SF commercial building soft-story retrofit costs $100,000-$250,000 total. A 20,000 SF URM comprehensive retrofit costs $300,000-$700,000. Costs depend on the building's existing condition, the performance objective selected, and the amount of architectural restoration required after structural work.

### Do commercial building tenants need to relocate during seismic retrofit in Glendale?

Tenant relocation depends on the retrofit scope and construction phasing. Many Glendale commercial seismic retrofits are designed to allow continued building occupancy during construction through careful phasing and off-hours work schedules. Comprehensive retrofits of URM buildings sometimes require temporary tenant relocation for portions of the work. AAA Engineering Design develops construction phasing plans that minimize tenant displacement and business interruption.

### What financing options exist for Glendale commercial seismic retrofits?

Glendale commercial building owners access several financing mechanisms for seismic retrofits: PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing through Los Angeles County, SBA disaster mitigation loans, commercial construction loans from local lenders familiar with retrofit projects, and tax deductions under IRC Section 179 for seismic retrofit costs. Some Glendale property owners recover retrofit costs through increased property values and reduced earthquake insurance premiums.

### Can seismic retrofit increase my Glendale commercial building's value?

Yes. Seismically retrofitted Glendale commercial buildings consistently achieve 10-20% higher property valuations compared to non-retrofitted comparable buildings. Retrofit completion removes the contingent liability of mandatory ordinance compliance, qualifies the building for favorable earthquake insurance rates, and makes the property more attractive to tenants and buyers who recognize the safety and business continuity benefits of seismic resilience.

### What happens if I do not comply with Glendale's mandatory retrofit ordinance?

Non-compliance with Glendale's mandatory seismic retrofit ordinances results in escalating enforcement actions including warning notices, fines, restricted occupancy permits that limit building use, and potential vacate orders. Building owners also face personal liability exposure if earthquake damage to a non-retrofitted building injures occupants or the public. The cost of compliance increases over time as construction prices rise and enforcement actions add administrative penalties.

### How does a non-ductile concrete frame retrofit differ from a URM retrofit?

Non-ductile concrete frame retrofits address the brittle failure modes of concrete buildings designed before ductile detailing requirements were adopted in the mid-1970s. These retrofits typically involve adding steel moment frames or concrete shear walls to reduce demands on the existing concrete frame, jacketing existing concrete columns with steel or fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps to increase ductility, and strengthening beam-column joints to prevent shear failures. URM retrofits focus on wall anchorage, parapet bracing, and adding entirely new lateral force-resisting systems because the existing masonry walls lack any ductile behavior.
