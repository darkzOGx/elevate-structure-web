AAA Engineering Design provides specialized hillside foundation solutions for the Coachella Valley's prestigious hillside properties.

## Why Rancho Mirage Hillside Properties Need Specialized Engineering

Rancho Mirage's most desirable properties often sit on slopes offering panoramic views of the Santa Rosa Mountains and Coachella Valley. These hillside locations present challenges including slope stability, variable bearing conditions, lateral earth pressure, and drainage management.

## Hillside Foundation Types

### Stepped Foundation System

For moderate slopes (10-20%) with multiple foundation levels following grade.

### Pier and Grade Beam Foundation

For steeper slopes (20-40%) with drilled piers extending to competent bearing.

### Caisson Foundation

For severe slopes or heavy loads with large diameter drilled shafts and deep embedment.

## Hillside Foundation Costs

| Slope Severity | Foundation Type | Engineering Cost | Construction Cost |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Moderate (10-20%) | Stepped | $8,000-$12,000 | $40,000-$80,000 |
| Steep (20-30%) | Pier & Beam | $12,000-$18,000 | $80,000-$150,000 |
