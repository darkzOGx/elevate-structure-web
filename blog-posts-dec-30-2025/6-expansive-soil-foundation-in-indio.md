## Understanding Expansive Soils in Indio

Expansive soils contain clay minerals that swell when wet and shrink when dry. In Indio's desert climate, these soils experience dramatic moisture changes from irrigation, rare rainfall events, and landscaping.

### Signs of Expansive Soil Damage

Common warning signs include cracks in interior drywall, exterior stucco cracking, doors and windows that stick, cracks in concrete slabs, gaps between walls and floors, and uneven floors.

## Foundation Solutions for Indio's Expansive Soils

### Post-Tensioned Slab Foundations

The most common solution featuring concrete slabs reinforced with high-strength steel cables that are tensioned after concrete cures, creating a rigid, crack-resistant slab.

### Drilled Pier Foundations

For severe soil conditions with concrete piers drilled through expansive layer to stable soils, isolating the structure from soil movement.
