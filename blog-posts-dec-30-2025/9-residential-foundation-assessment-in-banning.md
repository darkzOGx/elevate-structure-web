## What is a Residential Foundation Assessment?

A foundation assessment is a systematic evaluation of your home's foundation by a licensed structural engineer. We examine the foundation's current condition, identify any deficiencies, and provide recommendations.

### Why Banning Homes Need Assessment

Banning's location in the San Gorgonio Pass creates unique challenges including variable soils, temperature extremes, wind exposure, age of housing stock, and development history on former agricultural land.

## When You Need Assessment

Schedule assessment for home purchase due diligence, visible signs of problems (cracks, sticking doors, uneven floors), pre-renovation planning, and real estate transactions.

## Assessment Costs

| Assessment Type | Typical Cost | Turnaround |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Basic Visual Assessment | $800-$1,200 | 2-3 days |
| Comprehensive Assessment | $1,500-$2,500 | 3-5 days |
