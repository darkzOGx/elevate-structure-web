## Understanding Foundation Problems in Beaumont

Beaumont has experienced explosive growth, with both older homes and newer construction experiencing foundation problems due to expansive soils, rapid development on improperly compacted fill, drainage changes, and temperature extremes.

### Warning Signs

Interior signs include diagonal cracks, horizontal cracks in drywall, gaps between walls and ceiling/floor, doors and windows that won't close, and sloping floors.

## Foundation Repair Methods

### Helical Pier Systems

Steel piers with helical flights screwed into soil past unstable layers to stable bearing with hydraulic lifting to restore foundation level.

### Push Pier Systems

Steel piers driven to bedrock using structure weight for permanent support with lifting and stabilization capabilities.
