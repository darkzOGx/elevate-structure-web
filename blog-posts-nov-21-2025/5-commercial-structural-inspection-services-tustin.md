## What Are Common Inspection Findings?

**Finding 1: Concrete Deterioration and Spalling**
Older concrete buildings exhibit cracking, spalling, or reinforcing steel corrosion from age, moisture exposure, or inadequate construction affecting structural capacity and durability.

**Solution:** Our inspection reports document concrete conditions with photo documentation and severity ratings. Recommendations range from minor repairs for cosmetic issues to comprehensive rehabilitation for structural deficiencies. Concrete testing may be recommended determining concrete strength and corrosion extent. Repair specifications ensure proper restoration techniques.

**Finding 2: Seismic Deficiencies**
Buildings constructed before modern seismic codes may lack adequate lateral force resistance, have improper connection details, or include brittle structural elements creating earthquake vulnerabilities.

**Solution:** We evaluate buildings against current seismic standards identifying specific deficiencies. Seismic retrofit recommendations prioritize life safety improvements with cost-effective solutions. Our reports describe retrofit strategies ranging from simple connection improvements to comprehensive lateral system additions appropriate for building type and use.

**Finding 3: Wood Framing Deterioration**
Wood-framed commercial buildings experience decay from moisture intrusion, termite damage, or inadequate maintenance compromising structural integrity and requiring repairs.

**Solution:** Our inspections identify wood deterioration through visual examination and probing where accessible. We document damage extent and affected structural members. Recommendations address both immediate repairs and moisture source elimination preventing future deterioration. Structural reinforcement designs restore load capacity where members are damaged.

**Finding 4: Foundation Settlement or Movement**
Building foundations experiencing differential settlement create cracking, door/window operation issues, or structural distress requiring investigation and potential remediation.

**Solution:** We document settlement indicators including crack patterns, floor slopes, and structural distortions. Our analysis determines whether observed settlement is historic and stabilized or ongoing requiring intervention. Recommendations may include foundation monitoring, soil investigation, or foundation underpinning depending on conditions. Cost estimates help property owners plan appropriate responses.
