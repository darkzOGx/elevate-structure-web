## What Are Common Parking Garage Challenges?

**Challenge 1: Long-Span Floor Systems**
Parking garage floor plates require long spans between columns to optimize parking layouts while supporting heavy vehicle loads and accommodating drainage slopes.

**Solution:** We design efficient floor systems using post-tensioned concrete, precast double-tee systems, or conventionally reinforced concrete slabs. Column spacing typically ranges from 55-60 feet optimizing parking module layouts. Floor systems incorporate proper slopes (minimum 2%) for drainage to deck drains or scuppers.

**Challenge 2: Seismic Design for Parking Structures**
Multi-level parking garages create large, open structural systems subject to significant seismic forces from Orange County's location in high seismic zones.

**Solution:** Our structural designs incorporate appropriate lateral force-resisting systems including moment frames, shear walls, or dual systems. Seismic detailing ensures ductile behavior during earthquakes. Connection design accommodates thermal movements and seismic displacements maintaining structural integrity.

**Challenge 3: Waterproofing and Durability**
Parking garage exposure to weather, de-icing salts (in some regions), and continuous moisture requires durable structural systems and effective waterproofing.

**Solution:** We design structural systems with proper drainage slopes, expansion joints, and appropriate cover over reinforcing steel. Waterproofing systems integrate with structural design protecting concrete from moisture intrusion and chloride attack. Durability design extends garage service life reducing long-term maintenance costs.

**Challenge 4: ADA Compliance and Circulation**
Parking facilities must provide accessible parking spaces, proper circulation to elevators, and ramp slopes meeting disabled access requirements.

**Solution:** Our designs incorporate accessible parking on each level near vertical circulation, proper aisle widths for van-accessible spaces, and ramp slopes complying with California Building Code requirements. Signage and wayfinding coordinate with structural layout ensuring code compliance.

## Structural Systems for Parking Garages

**Post-Tensioned Concrete**
Post-tensioned concrete floor systems provide efficient long spans with reduced floor thickness compared to conventionally reinforced concrete. Post-tensioning reduces cracking improving durability and waterproofing performance. We design post-tensioned systems for parking garages optimizing span lengths and structural depth.

Typical post-tensioned parking structures use 8-10 inch thick floor slabs spanning 55-60 feet between columns. Column-free parking bays improve parking efficiency and circulation. Post-tensioning tendons stressed after concrete placement create compression forces offsetting tensile stresses from vehicle loads.

**Precast Concrete Systems**
Precast double-tee systems offer rapid construction and predictable quality for parking structures. Double-tees typically span 60 feet with 8-10 foot widths creating efficient parking layouts. We design precast systems coordinating with manufacturers for optimal member sizes and connection details.

Precast systems require careful connection design accommodating seismic forces and thermal movements. Structural design ensures ductile behavior and load transfer between precast elements.

**Cast-in-Place Concrete**
Conventionally reinforced cast-in-place concrete provides design flexibility for irregular geometries or complex loading conditions. Cast-in-place construction accommodates site-specific requirements and aesthetic treatments.

## Ramp Design and Circulation

**Ramp Geometry**
Parking garage ramps require proper slopes allowing vehicle access while meeting code requirements. Typical ramp slopes range from 5-7% for straight ramps with flatter slopes at turns and ramp-to-floor transitions. We design ramp geometry optimizing circulation while ensuring safe vehicle operation.

Ramp widths accommodate traffic patterns with single-lane ramps typically 12-14 feet wide and two-lane ramps 20-24 feet wide. Clear heights throughout ramps maintain minimum 7 feet clear for vehicle passage.

**Ramp Structural Design**
Ramps create sloped structural members requiring special reinforcing details and construction considerations. Structural design addresses varying floor elevations, drainage transitions, and load transfer to adjacent floor levels. We detail ramp connections ensuring proper structural behavior.

## Waterproofing and Drainage

**Drainage Systems**
Parking garage floor slabs slope to deck drains or perimeter scuppers collecting stormwater and preventing ponding. Typical floor slopes range from 2-4% directing water to drainage collection points. We design structural slopes coordinating with drainage layout.

Expansion joints accommodate thermal movements and structural deflections while maintaining waterproofing integrity. Joint design prevents water intrusion to lower levels protecting structural elements.

**Waterproofing Strategies**
Above-grade parking levels may include waterproofing membranes protecting lower levels from water intrusion. Below-grade parking requires comprehensive waterproofing systems resisting hydrostatic pressure and groundwater infiltration.

Structural design accommodates waterproofing systems with proper slopes, drainage, and substrate preparation. Waterproofing coordination ensures integrated protection systems.

## Accessibility and Code Compliance

**Accessible Parking Requirements**
California Building Code requires accessible parking spaces on each parking level with proper dimensions, signage, and access aisles. We design parking layouts accommodating required accessible spaces with connections to accessible routes leading to building entrances or elevators.

Van-accessible spaces require 11-foot-wide access aisles and proper vertical clearance. Structural design ensures adequate clear heights and proper slopes meeting accessibility requirements.

**Vertical Circulation**
Elevators and stairs provide vertical circulation connecting parking levels to building destinations. Structural design accommodates elevator pits, equipment rooms, and stair tower construction. We coordinate structural systems with vertical circulation elements ensuring code-compliant access.

## Security and Safety Features

**Structural Support for Security Systems**
Modern parking garages incorporate security cameras, access control systems, and emergency call boxes requiring structural support and infrastructure. Structural design accommodates security equipment mounting and cable routing.
