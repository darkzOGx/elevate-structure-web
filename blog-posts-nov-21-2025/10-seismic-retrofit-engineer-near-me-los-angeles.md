## What Are Common LA Seismic Deficiencies?

**Deficiency 1: Soft-Story Buildings**
Buildings with open parking, retail, or large openings on ground floors lack adequate lateral resistance creating earthquake collapse risk affecting thousands of LA buildings.

**Solution:** We design soft-story retrofits using steel moment frames, steel braced frames, or shear walls strengthening ground floors. Retrofit designs maintain parking and commercial use while adding earthquake resistance. Our LA soft-story experience enables efficient designs meeting ordinance requirements while minimizing construction costs and tenant disruption.

**Deficiency 2: Inadequate Foundation Connections**
Older homes built before foundation bolting requirements lack proper connections between wood framing and concrete foundations allowing structures to slide during earthquakes.

**Solution:** Our foundation retrofit designs specify foundation bolting connecting mudsills to foundations at required spacing. Bolting installation involves accessing crawl spaces installing bolts through mudsills into foundations. Foundation retrofits include cripple wall bracing creating comprehensive earthquake protection for residential structures.

**Deficiency 3: Unreinforced Masonry Construction**
Brick buildings without steel reinforcement experience wall separation and collapse during earthquakes creating extreme life safety hazards requiring comprehensive retrofits.

**Solution:** We design URM retrofits including wall anchoring connecting masonry walls to floor and roof diaphragms, diaphragm strengthening creating load paths for seismic forces, and structural reinforcement using steel frames or concrete shear walls. URM retrofit designs meet Los Angeles ordinance requirements while preserving historic building character where applicable.

**Deficiency 4: Non-Ductile Concrete Frames**
Older concrete buildings lack ductile detailing creating brittle behavior during earthquakes with collapse potential requiring seismic strengthening.

**Solution:** Our non-ductile concrete retrofit designs strengthen columns and joints using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapping, steel jacketing, or concrete jacketing. Retrofit strategies improve ductility preventing brittle failures. We design cost-effective solutions meeting ASCE 41 seismic rehabilitation standards.

## Los Angeles Mandatory Retrofit Programs

**Soft-Story Retrofit Ordinance**
Los Angeles requires seismic retrofits for wood-frame buildings with two or more stories built before 1978 having ground-floor soft-story conditions. Ordinance affects approximately 13,500 buildings requiring retrofits by established deadlines based on building tier classification.

Soft-story retrofit deadlines vary by building tier with earlier deadlines for larger buildings. Property owners facing ordinance compliance should engage seismic engineers promptly meeting deadline requirements and avoiding penalties.

**Non-Ductile Concrete Retrofit Ordinance**
Los Angeles requires seismic evaluation and potential retrofits for non-ductile concrete buildings. Ordinance affects concrete buildings built before 1978 lacking ductile seismic detailing requiring engineering assessments and retrofits where necessary.

**Unreinforced Masonry Ordinance**
Division 88 requires URM building retrofits meeting earthquake safety standards. URM ordinance has been effective for decades with most LA brick buildings completing required retrofits.

## Seismic Retrofit Design Approaches

**Soft-Story Retrofit Systems**
Soft-story retrofits strengthen ground floors using lateral force-resisting systems including steel moment frames providing lateral resistance through rigid beam-column connections, steel braced frames using diagonal braces resisting lateral forces, or plywood shear walls where configurations permit. We select appropriate systems based on building configuration, construction costs, and architectural impacts.

Retrofit designs maintain existing parking and commercial uses where possible minimizing property value impacts. Structural layouts accommodate existing uses while providing code-required earthquake resistance.

**Foundation Anchorage Methods**
Foundation retrofits install anchor bolts connecting wood mudsills to concrete foundations. Typical bolt spacing ranges from 4-6 feet depending on building configuration and seismic loads. We design foundation anchorage meeting current building code requirements.

Foundation retrofit construction accesses crawl spaces or basement areas installing bolts from beneath buildings. Limited access areas may require special construction approaches.

**Cripple Wall Bracing Design**
Cripple walls receive plywood sheathing on interior or exterior faces creating shear walls resisting lateral forces. Plywood nailing and connection details ensure proper load transfer. We design cripple wall bracing coordinating with foundation anchorage creating integrated seismic systems.

## Retrofit Construction Considerations

**Tenant Displacement**
Multi-family soft-story retrofits may require temporary tenant relocation during construction. Los Angeles ordinances include tenant protection provisions including relocation assistance and rent stabilization. We design retrofit sequences minimizing displacement requirements where possible.

**Construction Phasing**
Large building retrofits use construction phasing maintaining building operations during construction. Phased approaches complete retrofits in sections allowing continued occupancy. We coordinate phasing plans with contractors balancing construction efficiency with occupant needs.

**Retrofit Construction Duration**
Single-family foundation retrofits typically require 1-4 weeks construction depending on building size and access. Soft-story retrofits span 3-12 months depending on building size and complexity. Construction timelines affect tenant displacement and property operations requiring careful planning.

## Seismic Retrofit Incentive Programs

**Earthquake Retrofit Grant Programs**
Los Angeles and California offer financial assistance programs supporting seismic retrofits. Grant programs vary by building type and location providing funding for retrofit design or construction costs. We help property owners identify applicable assistance programs.

**Earthquake Brace + Bolt Program**
California Earthquake Authority's Brace + Bolt program provides grants up to $3,000 for single-family foundation retrofits in qualifying zip codes. Program covers portions of retrofit costs making earthquake improvements more affordable for homeowners.

**Property Tax Exclusions**
California Revenue and Taxation Code allows property tax exclusions for seismic retrofit improvements preventing tax increases from retrofit value additions. Tax benefits reduce overall retrofit costs for property owners.

## Voluntary Seismic Upgrades

**Beyond Code Retrofits**
Property owners may choose seismic improvements beyond minimum ordinance requirements. Enhanced retrofits provide superior earthquake performance protecting property investments and reducing earthquake damage risks.

We design voluntary seismic upgrades based on owner objectives ranging from basic code compliance to comprehensive seismic rehabilitation achieving specific performance objectives.

**ASCE 41 Seismic Rehabilitation**
ASCE 41 provides systematic seismic rehabilitation methodologies with defined performance objectives including operational performance (minimal damage), immediate occupancy (limited damage), or life safety (collapse prevention). We design retrofits achieving specified performance objectives.

## Retrofit Financing Options

**Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)**
PACE financing enables seismic retrofit projects with repayment through property tax assessments. PACE programs offer long-term financing making retrofits more affordable through extended repayment periods.
