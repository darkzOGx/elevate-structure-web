ADU structural engineering in Bonita enables homeowners to add valuable accessory dwelling units to their properties with full California Building Code compliance. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers provide comprehensive ADU structural design services throughout Bonita, Chula Vista, National City, and San Diego County's South Bay communities, helping families create rental income, multigenerational living spaces, or home offices.

Bonita's larger lot sizes and established residential neighborhoods make it an ideal location for ADU development. Whether you're converting an existing garage, building a detached backyard unit, or adding a JADU within your home, proper structural engineering is essential for permit approval and long-term performance.

## What is ADU Structural Engineering in Bonita?

**Direct Answer:**
ADU structural engineering encompasses the PE-stamped structural design services required to add accessory dwelling units to residential properties in Bonita. This includes foundation design, floor and wall framing, roof structure, and lateral (earthquake) bracing systems. California law now streamlines ADU permitting, but San Diego County still requires professionally engineered structural plans for building permit approval.

California's ADU laws have dramatically simplified the approval process, but structural safety requirements remain unchanged:

- **Foundation engineering** - New or modified foundations for ADU loads
- **Structural framing design** - Walls, floors, and roof systems per CBC
- **Lateral force resistance** - Shear walls and connections for earthquakes
- **Existing structure coordination** - For attached ADUs and garage conversions
- **Code compliance documentation** - PE-stamped calculations and drawings

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I build an ADU on any residential lot in Bonita?

Yes. California law now prohibits local restrictions that prevent ADUs on single-family residential lots. San Diego County must approve ADUs that meet state requirements regardless of lot size, zoning, or prior restrictions. The only limitations are state-mandated size and setback requirements.

### Do I need separate utility connections for my Bonita ADU?

Not always. JADUs can share utilities with the main home. Detached ADUs typically need separate electrical panels, but water and sewer connections may be shared in some cases. San Diego County determines connection requirements during plan review.

### How big can my ADU be in Bonita?

Detached ADUs can be up to 1,200 square feet. Attached ADUs can be up to 1,000 square feet or 50% of the primary dwelling (whichever is less). JADUs within existing space are limited to 500 square feet. These are state-mandated maximums that San Diego County must honor.

### Can I rent out my ADU immediately after construction?

Yes. California law prohibits owner-occupancy requirements for ADUs. You can rent your ADU immediately upon receiving a certificate of occupancy. Short-term rentals (Airbnb, VRBO) may have separate local restrictions.
