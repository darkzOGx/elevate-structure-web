## What Is Distribution Center Structural Engineering?

**Direct Answer:** Distribution center structural engineering involves designing structural systems for high-volume logistics facilities including foundations, high-bay framing, heavy-duty floor slabs, and dock structures. California-licensed Professional Engineers design systems supporting high-rack storage, material handling equipment, and continuous forklift operations.

Distribution centers require structural systems capable of supporting intensive operations—heavy floor loads from racking systems, clear heights of 32-40+ feet, and large column-free spaces for efficient material flow. Concrete tilt-up construction is the predominant building system.
