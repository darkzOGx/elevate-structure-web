## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do medical office buildings require OSHPD approval?**
OSHPD/HCAi oversight is required for certain licensed healthcare facilities. General medical office buildings without surgery centers typically don't require OSHPD review.

**What structural considerations apply to MRI rooms?**
MRI rooms require vibration isolation, heavy equipment pads, and coordination with magnetic shielding. Structural systems must minimize vibration from adjacent uses.
