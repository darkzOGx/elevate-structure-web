## What Is Commercial Building Renovation Engineering?

**Direct Answer:** Commercial building renovation engineering involves analyzing existing building structures and designing modifications for building upgrades, additions, seismic retrofits, and adaptive reuse projects. California-licensed Professional Engineers assess existing structural capacity, design reinforcement as needed, and prepare PE-stamped plans for permit approval.

Renovation projects require careful analysis of existing conditions because original construction may not meet current code requirements, and modifications can affect overall structural performance.
