Finding an ADU structural engineer near you in Downey ensures you work with a professional who understands California's ADU regulations and Downey's specific permit requirements. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers specialize in accessory dwelling unit engineering including garage conversions, detached ADUs, attached additions, and Junior ADUs (JADUs). With California's favorable ADU laws and strong rental demand in Downey, ADU construction offers homeowners significant income potential—but requires proper structural engineering for permit approval and safe construction.

Downey's residential neighborhoods provide excellent ADU opportunities, with garage conversions being particularly popular due to existing structures and lot configurations. Our engineers have completed numerous ADU projects throughout Downey, understanding both the technical requirements and the permit process that gets projects built.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need an architect and structural engineer for an ADU?**
California law allows ADUs to be built from structural engineer plans alone in many cases. We can discuss whether additional design services are needed for your specific project.

**What's the maximum ADU size in Downey?**
Detached ADUs can be up to 1,200 square feet on standard residential lots. Attached ADUs have different size limits based on existing home size. JADUs are limited to 500 square feet.

**How long does ADU construction take?**
Construction typically takes 3-6 months for garage conversions and 5-10 months for new detached ADUs, depending on scope and contractor availability.

**Can I build an ADU if I don't have parking?**
California ADU law prohibits parking requirements for ADUs in most situations. Loss of garage parking for garage conversions doesn't prevent ADU approval.

**What about setbacks and lot coverage?**
California law sets maximum setbacks for ADUs at 4 feet from side and rear property lines. Lot coverage limits have been relaxed for ADU construction. We design within these requirements.
