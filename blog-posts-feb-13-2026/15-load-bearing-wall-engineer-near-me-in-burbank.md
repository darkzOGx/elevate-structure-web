## What Is Load Bearing Wall Engineering and Why Does Burbank Require It?

Load bearing wall engineering is the structural analysis and design process that allows safe removal of walls carrying structural loads. When a load bearing wall is removed, its weight -- from the roof, ceiling, upper floors, and the wall itself -- must transfer through a replacement beam supported by posts to the foundation. A PE-licensed structural engineer designs this alternative load path.

In Burbank, wall removal is one of the most common residential structural engineering projects. Burbank's housing stock includes thousands of homes built from the 1930s through the 1970s with compartmentalized floor plans. Today's homeowners prefer open concept layouts combining kitchens, dining rooms, and living areas -- requiring removal of one or more load bearing walls.

The City of Burbank requires a building permit with PE-stamped structural calculations and drawings for all load bearing wall removals. Attempting removal without proper engineering is dangerous and illegal, causing sagging, cracking, misalignment, and potentially structural collapse. Unpermitted removals create legal liability, insurance problems, and resale complications.

AAA Engineering Design has designed hundreds of wall removals across Southern California, including numerous Burbank projects. Our PE-licensed engineers evaluate structures, design replacement beams, produce permit-ready plans, and support contractors. Call (949) 981-4448 for your project. Our [structural inspection services](/services/structural-inspection) provide comprehensive pre-modification assessment.

## What Load Bearing Wall Engineering Services Are Available in Burbank?

Burbank homeowners need a range of wall removal and modification services, from single wall removal to comprehensive open concept remodeling. Understanding the service options helps you scope your project accurately.

### Single Wall Removal

The most straightforward service involves removing one load bearing wall and replacing it with a beam. Single wall removals are common for:

- Opening a kitchen to a dining room
- Combining a living room and family room
- Widening a hallway or passage
- Creating a larger master bedroom

Engineering for a single wall removal includes load analysis, beam sizing, post design, foundation evaluation, connection detailing, and construction drawings. For a typical Burbank home, single wall removal engineering costs $2,000-$4,000.

### Multiple Wall Removal / Open Concept Design

Creating a fully open concept layout often requires removing two, three, or more load bearing walls. This comprehensive approach demands more extensive structural analysis because:

- Each wall removal changes the load distribution in the building
- Multiple beam and post configurations must work together as a system
- Lateral force resistance (earthquake bracing) must be maintained after multiple walls are removed
- Foundation loads concentrate at fewer points, potentially requiring foundation reinforcement

Engineering for multiple wall removals costs $4,000-$8,000+ depending on the number of walls and complexity of the structural system.

### Partial Wall Removal

Some Burbank homeowners prefer partial wall removal -- creating a wide opening while leaving portions of the wall in place for architectural definition, cabinet backing, or structural simplification. Partial removals require the same engineering analysis as full removals but may result in shorter beam spans and reduced structural complexity.

### Wall Modification (New Openings)

Adding doorways, pass-throughs, or enlarged openings in load bearing walls requires engineering for headers that span the new opening while carrying loads above. Headers are beams installed within the wall thickness, allowing the wall to remain while accommodating the new opening. This service is useful for:

- Adding a doorway between rooms
- Creating a kitchen pass-through window
- Widening an existing doorway
- Installing larger windows in load bearing walls

### Second-Story Support Evaluation

For two-story Burbank homes, removing a wall on the first floor requires analysis of how the modification affects the second floor and roof structure above. Second-story support evaluation ensures that the replacement beam adequately carries the combined loads from the roof, second floor, and any walls stacked above the removed wall.

Our [residential structural engineering](/services/residential-structural-engineering) team handles all of these service types with expertise specific to Southern California residential construction.

## How Does the Load Bearing Wall Removal Process Work in California?

The wall removal process follows a defined sequence from initial evaluation through construction completion. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure a safe, code-compliant, and well-executed project.

### Step 1: Initial Consultation and Site Visit

Every load bearing wall project begins with a phone consultation (free) followed by a site visit. During the site visit, our PE-licensed engineer:

**Identifies the wall's structural role**: The engineer determines whether the wall in question is load bearing by examining the framing above and below the wall, the load path from roof to foundation, and the wall's relationship to other structural elements. In Burbank homes, walls running perpendicular to floor and ceiling joists are typically load bearing, while walls running parallel to joists may or may not carry structural loads depending on the specific framing configuration.

**Assesses the loads carried**: The engineer calculates the specific loads the wall carries, including dead loads (weight of the structure itself), live loads (occupancy loads from floors above), and roof loads (including consideration for wind and seismic forces). For two-story Burbank homes, first-floor wall removals must account for all loads from the second floor and roof.

**Evaluates the foundation**: The engineer inspects the existing foundation at the wall location and at proposed post locations to determine whether the foundation can support concentrated beam and post loads. In many Burbank homes, foundation modifications are needed when wall loads are concentrated into post locations.

**Documents existing conditions**: Photographs, measurements, and notes record the existing wall configuration, surrounding framing, and foundation conditions. This documentation supports the engineering design and serves as a record of pre-construction conditions.

### Step 2: Structural Engineering Design (2-3 Weeks)

Based on the site visit findings, our engineers design the complete load path replacement. The design process includes:

**Load analysis**: Detailed calculation of all loads the wall currently carries, including tributary area analysis for roof and floor loads, wall self-weight, and any point loads from concentrated framing above.

**Beam design**: Selection and sizing of the replacement beam based on span length, total loads, deflection limits, and material availability. Beam options include engineered lumber (LVL, PSL, or glulam beams) for spans up to 20 feet with moderate loads, and structural steel (wide-flange I-beams or HSS sections) for longer spans and heavier loads where minimum beam depth is critical.

**Post and foundation design**: Sizing of support posts at each end of the beam, plus foundation modifications when existing continuous footings cannot support concentrated post loads. New reinforced concrete pad footings are common at post locations in Burbank homes.

**Connection design and construction drawings**: The complete engineering package includes connection details between beam, posts, and foundation; temporary shoring requirements; and construction sequence drawings. All connections transfer both gravity and seismic forces.

### Step 3: Permit Submission and Review (3-6 Weeks)

We submit the complete engineering package to the City of Burbank Building Division for plan check review. Burbank's plan check process involves review by the city's structural plan check engineers, who verify:

- Structural adequacy of the beam, posts, and connections
- Foundation capacity for concentrated loads
- California Building Code compliance
- Seismic force resistance maintenance
- Completeness of calculations and drawings

Our familiarity with the City of Burbank's plan check expectations helps achieve approval efficiently. We respond to plan check corrections promptly, typically within one week.

### Step 4: Construction (3-7 Days per Wall)

With the approved permit, your licensed contractor executes the wall removal following our engineering plans. The construction sequence includes: installing temporary shoring on both sides of the wall, removing wall finishes to expose framing, lifting the new beam into position on support posts, making all connections per engineering specifications, removing the original wall framing, completing foundation work (if new pad footings are required), removing temporary shoring once permanent connections are complete, and restoring drywall, texture, painting, and flooring.

### Step 5: Inspection and Approval

The City of Burbank conducts inspections at critical stages -- typically foundation, framing (beam/post installation), and final. AAA Engineering Design is available to attend inspections and address any inspector questions about the structural design.

Our [permit engineering](/services/permit-engineering) services ensure smooth navigation of Burbank's permitting and inspection process.

## What Are Regional Considerations for Load Bearing Wall Removal in Burbank and Southern California?

Burbank's location, housing stock, and building department practices create specific considerations for wall removal projects.

### Burbank Housing Stock Characteristics

Burbank's residential neighborhoods contain homes spanning nearly a century of construction. 1920s-1940s bungalows and Craftsman homes feature plaster-over-lath walls and often irregular load paths requiring careful investigation. 1950s-1960s ranch homes in Magnolia Park and Rancho Equestrian feature platform framing ideal for open concept conversions. 1970s-1980s homes include truss-roof construction requiring special attention during wall removal. Two-story homes require additional analysis as replacement beams carry both second-floor and roof loads.

### Seismic Considerations

Burbank falls within Seismic Design Category D due to its proximity to the Verdugo Fault and the Raymond Fault. Every wall removal design addresses seismic implications including shear wall replacement (designing new lateral bracing elsewhere in the building), diaphragm continuity (maintaining force transfer between the diaphragm and replacement beam), and foundation anchoring (installing hold-down hardware at post locations to resist uplift and lateral forces).

### City of Burbank Plan Check Process

The City of Burbank Building Division maintains thorough plan check standards for structural work. Plan check engineers review load calculations, beam sizing, connection details, and code compliance carefully. Engineers who submit complete, well-organized packages with thorough calculations experience faster review times and fewer correction cycles.

Burbank's plan check timeline is typically 3-6 weeks for initial review, with 2-3 week turnaround for correction cycles. Our engineers' experience with Burbank's specific expectations helps minimize correction cycles.

### Burbank Hillside Area Considerations

Properties in the Burbank Hillside area face additional considerations including sloped floor framing with non-standard load paths, retaining wall integration, hillside foundation systems, and limited construction access. These conditions require more extensive investigation and analysis.

## How Much Does Load Bearing Wall Removal Cost in Burbank?

Load bearing wall removal costs in Burbank vary based on wall length, loads carried, beam material, foundation requirements, and finish restoration scope.

### Engineering Cost Ranges

| Service | Fee Range | Timeline |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Load bearing wall assessment | $500 - $1,000 | 1 week |
| Single wall removal engineering | $2,000 - $4,000 | 2-3 weeks |
| Multiple wall removal / open concept | $4,000 - $8,000+ | 3-5 weeks |
| Partial wall removal / new opening | $1,500 - $3,000 | 2-3 weeks |
| Header design for new doorway | $1,200 - $2,500 | 1-2 weeks |
| Construction observation | $500 - $1,500 | 1-2 visits |

### Total Project Cost Ranges (Engineering + Permits + Construction + Finishes)

| Project Type | Total Cost Range |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Single interior wall removal (8-12 ft span) | $5,000 - $12,000 |
| Single wall removal (12-18 ft span) | $10,000 - $18,000 |
| Long span wall removal (18-24 ft) with steel beam | $15,000 - $25,000+ |
| Multiple wall open concept conversion | $20,000 - $45,000+ |
| Wall removal with foundation modification | Add $3,000 - $8,000 |

### Cost Factors Specific to Burbank

**Beam material**: Engineered lumber beams (LVL, PSL) cost $15-$30 per lineal foot, while structural steel beams cost $30-$70 per lineal foot installed. Steel is required for longer spans and heavier loads but adds material and labor cost.

**Ceiling height**: Burbank homes with standard 8-foot ceilings leave limited space for beam depth. "Flush" beam installations that conceal the beam within the ceiling depth require more complex framing and cost $2,000-$5,000 more than exposed or dropped beam configurations.

**Foundation modifications**: Concentrated post loads frequently exceed the capacity of existing continuous footings. New pad footings cost $1,500-$4,000 each to install, including excavation, reinforcing, and concrete.

**Two-story loads**: First-floor wall removals in two-story homes carry double the load of single-story walls, requiring larger beams, stronger posts, and more substantial foundations. Engineering and construction costs increase 30-50% for two-story load conditions.

**Finish work**: Drywall patching, ceiling repair, flooring transitions, and painting after wall removal add $2,000-$8,000 depending on the extent of finish work and quality of materials.

**Permit fees**: City of Burbank building permit fees for wall removal typically range from $500-$1,500 based on construction valuation.

### Comparing Quotes

When comparing quotes, ensure each includes the same scope: PE-stamped engineering, permit coordination, temporary shoring, foundation modifications, hardware, finish repair, and clean-up. The lowest quote often omits foundation work or finish repair -- items that appear as costly change orders during construction.

---

## How Do You Select the Right Load Bearing Wall Engineer Near You in Burbank?

Choosing the right structural engineer for your Burbank wall removal ensures safe execution, efficient permitting, and quality results.

### PE Licensure Verification

Only a California PE-licensed structural engineer can legally stamp structural calculations for wall removal. Verify your engineer's license at pels.ca.gov. Be cautious of contractors or designers offering "engineering" without PE credentials -- their work will not be accepted by the City of Burbank.

### Residential Specialization and Local Experience

Choose an engineer who regularly designs wall removals for homes similar to yours and who understands the City of Burbank Building Division's review expectations. Ask about their Burbank project count, experience with your home's construction era, and whether they provide construction observation. Engineers with local plan check familiarity reduce correction cycles and accelerate permit issuance.

### Communication and Contractor Coordination

Your engineer should explain technical concepts in plain language, respond within 24 hours, and be available for construction phase questions. The best outcomes occur when the engineer and contractor work collaboratively. For full-scope [residential structural engineering](/services/residential-structural-engineering), AAA Engineering Design coordinates with your contractor from design through construction.

## What Are Common Load Bearing Wall Removal Challenges in Burbank?

Burbank wall removal projects encounter specific challenges that experienced engineers anticipate and resolve.

### Hidden Utilities Within Walls

Load bearing walls in Burbank homes frequently contain plumbing pipes (vent stacks), electrical wiring, HVAC ducts, and gas lines. Discovering these utilities after demolition begins causes delays and additional costs. Our engineers identify utility routing during the site visit and coordinate utility relocation in the project scope.

### Beam Depth vs. Ceiling Height Limitations

Burbank homes with standard 8-foot ceilings present a challenge when replacement beams require significant depth. Solutions include using steel beams (greater strength at less depth than wood), flush beam installations recessed into the ceiling framing, or intermediate posts to reduce span. Our engineers discuss options with homeowners and recommend the approach that best balances structural requirements with architectural goals.

### Foundation Inadequacy at Post Locations

When loads concentrate at post locations, existing continuous strip footings often require supplementation. Foundation modifications range from simple epoxied dowel connections to new pad footings poured beneath existing footings. Our engineers evaluate foundation conditions during the site visit and include any needed modifications in the original scope and quote.

### Multiple Wall Removals and Cumulative Effects

Open concept conversions involving two or three wall removals require system-level analysis. Each wall removal affects the remaining structure -- for example, removing two parallel walls may overload exterior walls not designed for the additional weight. The engineer verifies that all remaining structural elements accommodate the redistributed loads.

### Lateral Force Resistance and Seismic Safety

Load bearing walls frequently serve as shear walls that resist earthquake forces. Removing these walls eliminates lateral bracing, requiring replacement shear walls or bracing elsewhere in the building. In Burbank's seismic environment near the Verdugo and Raymond faults, our engineers design replacement lateral systems that maintain or improve seismic performance.

### Older Home Construction Inconsistencies

Burbank homes built before 1960 frequently contain non-standard framing, undocumented modifications, and materials that don't match available records. Our engineers anticipate these inconsistencies and design flexible solutions that accommodate field conditions.
