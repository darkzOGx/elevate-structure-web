## What Is a Permit Engineer in Laguna Niguel?

**Direct Answer:** A permit engineer is a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) who provides the structural analysis, calculations, and stamped drawings required for building department permit approval. In Laguna Niguel, permit engineers evaluate proposed construction, design structural elements to meet California Building Code requirements, and provide documentation that building officials review during plan check.

The PE stamp on structural drawings certifies that a licensed engineer has designed the work and takes professional responsibility for its compliance with applicable codes. Building departments rely on this professional certification as part of their plan review process.

Our engineers understand what Laguna Niguel's building department expects and prepare documentation accordingly. This includes structural calculations demonstrating code compliance, drawings showing all structural elements, and specifications for materials and construction methods.

## What Projects Require a Permit Engineer?

**Direct Answer:** Projects requiring PE-stamped structural plans typically include room additions, garage conversions, structural wall modifications, second story additions, decks over 30 inches high, swimming pools, retaining walls over 4 feet, and any work affecting structural elements.
