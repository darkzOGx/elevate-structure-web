Steel moment frames allow architects to create the collaborative, open environments that Palo Alto technology companies prefer while providing robust seismic performance. Our engineers design moment frame systems using current seismic provisions and connection detailing that ensures reliable performance.

### Buckling-Restrained Braced Frames

Buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBFs) offer an alternative lateral system that concentrates seismic resistance at specific frame locations, freeing other areas for architectural expression.

**BRBF Applications:**
- Perimeter structural cores
- Interior braced bays
- Building additions and renovations
- Retrofit of existing structures
- Limited-footprint buildings
- Cost-sensitive projects

BRBFs provide excellent seismic performance with smaller member sizes than traditional braced frames, and our engineers incorporate these systems when project conditions favor concentrated lateral resistance.

### Composite Floor Systems
