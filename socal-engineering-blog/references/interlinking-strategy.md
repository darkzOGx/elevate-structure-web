## Link Architecture

### Three-Tier System

**Tier 1: Pillar Articles** (3-5 posts)
- Comprehensive 3,000-5,000 word guides
- Link to 10-15 cluster articles
- Examples:
  - Engineering Design Services Guide
  - Structural Engineering Comprehensive Guide
  - Choosing Engineering Design Consultants

**Tier 2: Cluster Articles** (20-40 posts)
- Focused 1,500-2,500 word articles
- Link back to 1 pillar article
- Link to 3-5 other cluster articles
- Link to 2-3 service pages
- Examples:
  - Custom House Engineering Design
  - Stormwater Design Engineer Roles
  - Benefits of Engineering Design Services

**Tier 3: Supporting Content** (50+ posts)
- City-specific, niche topics
- Link to 1-2 cluster articles
- Link to 1 pillar if relevant
- Link to 2-3 service pages

---

## Linking Rules

### Quantity Guidelines
- **Minimum**: 3 internal links per post
- **Optimal**: 5-8 internal links per post
- **Maximum**: 12 internal links per post (avoid over-linking)

### Link Distribution Per Post
- **Service Pages**: 2-3 links (primary monetization)
- **Pillar Articles**: 0-1 link (if highly relevant)
- **Cluster Articles**: 2-4 links (related topics)
- **Location Pages**: 0-1 link (if exists for that city)

### Placement Guidelines
- **First Link**: Within first 500 words (preferably first 300)
- **Throughout Body**: Distributed naturally, not clustered
- **Avoid Footer Spam**: No link lists at bottom
- **Contextual Only**: Every link must add value

---

## Anchor Text Strategy

### Service Page Links

**Structural Engineering Service**
- "structural engineering services"
- "professional structural engineering"
- "structural design services"
- "California structural engineers"
- "our structural engineering team"

**Civil Engineering Service**
- "civil engineering design"
- "site development services"
- "grading and drainage plans"
- "civil engineering expertise"

**Residential Services**
- "residential engineering services"
- "home engineering design"
- "custom home structural design"

**Commercial Services**
- "commercial engineering design"
- "commercial building engineering"
- "office building structural design"

### Blog Post Links

**Exact Match** (20-30% of anchors)
- "when to hire a structural engineer"
- "cost of engineering design services"
- "seismic retrofitting requirements"

**Partial Match** (40-50% of anchors)
- "learn about structural engineering"
- "guide to hiring engineers"
- "understand engineering costs"

**Branded/Natural** (20-30% of anchors)
- "our comprehensive guide"
- "read more about this topic"
- "this related article"
- "as we discussed in [topic]"

**Never:**
- "click here"
- "this link"
- "read more" (without context)

### Cluster 4: Geographic/Local SEO

**No Single Pillar** (distributed across main pillars)

**Posts by City:**
- [Service] in Long Beach
- [Service] in Irvine
- [Service] in Newport Beach
- [Service] in Los Angeles
- [Service] in San Diego
- Etc. (25+ cities)

**Service Links:**
- Relevant service for that post
- /locations/[city] (if exists)

---

## Interlinking Workflow

### For New Posts (Day of Publication)

1. **Identify Post Type**
   - Pillar, Cluster, or Supporting?
   - Which topic cluster?

2. **Select Outbound Links**
   - Find 1 pillar (if relevant)
   - Find 3-5 cluster posts (related topics)
   - Find 2-3 service pages (most relevant)
   - Use keyword tracking sheet to avoid over-linking same posts

3. **Add Links Throughout Content**
   - First link in first 300-500 words
   - Distribute remaining links naturally
   - Use varied, contextual anchor text

4. **Record Links**
   - Track in linking spreadsheet
   - Note source → target relationships
   - Track anchor text used

---

### For Existing Posts (Monthly Maintenance)

**Week 1 of Each Month:**
1. Review all posts published in previous month
2. Find 2-3 older posts that should link TO each new post
3. Add reciprocal links with contextual anchors
4. Update link tracking sheet

**Benefits:**
- Distributes authority to new content
- Keeps older content fresh
- Creates natural link network
- Prevents orphan pages

---

## Service Page Linking Priority

### Primary Services (Link Most Often)
1. Structural Engineering - Link in 60%+ of posts
2. Residential Services - Link in 40%+ of posts
3. Commercial Engineering - Link in 30%+ of posts
4. Civil Engineering - Link in 25%+ of posts

### Secondary Services (Link Selectively)
5. MEP Design - Link when topic-relevant
6. Seismic Retrofit - Link in seismic-related posts
7. Foundation Services - Link in foundation-related posts
8. Permit Services - Link in permitting-related posts

### Context-Specific Linking
- Residential post → Residential Services (always)
- Commercial post → Commercial Services (always)
- City post → Structural + most relevant service
- PAA post → Service matching the question

---

## Geographic Interlinking

### City-to-City Links
**Same County:**
- Irvine post → can link to Anaheim post
- Long Beach post → can link to Los Angeles post

**Different Counties:**
- Only if direct comparison or contrast
- Example: "While Long Beach has X, San Diego has Y"

### Regional Hub Strategy
**Orange County Hub** (future location page)
- All OC city posts link to it
- It links back to all OC posts

**Los Angeles County Hub**
- All LA County city posts link to it

**Repeat for each region**

---

## Linking to External Sites

### When to Link Out
- Building department websites (credibility)
- California Building Code resources (authority)
- Professional organizations (trust signals)
- Relevant government resources

### External Link Guidelines
- Open in new tab (target="_blank")
- Use rel="noopener" for security
- 2-3 external links per post maximum
- Only link to authoritative sources
- Never link to competitors
- Never link to marketplaces (like PlanetBids)

### External Link Examples

**Good External Links:**
- cityofirvine.org/building-safety
- dgs.ca.gov (CA Building Standards Commission)
- seaoc.org (Structural Engineers Association)
- iccsafe.org (International Code Council)

**Never Link To:**
- PlanetBids, ConstructConnect, BidClerk, etc.
- Competitor engineering firms
- Low-quality directories
- Spammy websites

---

## Broken Link Prevention

### Quarterly Review
- Check all internal links (use Screaming Frog or similar)
- Fix or replace broken links
- Update outdated links
- Remove links to deprecated pages

### Best Practices
- Use relative URLs for internal links (/blog/post-slug)
- Keep URL structure consistent
- Don't delete old posts without 301 redirects
- Monitor Google Search Console for 404 errors

---

## Link Velocity Guidelines

### New Blog Launch Phase (Months 1-3)
- Publish 5 posts per day
- Each post has 5-7 internal links
- Creates ~175 new internal links per week
- Focus: Building foundation network

### Established Phase (Month 4+)
- Publish 5 posts per day
- Monthly maintenance adds reciprocal links
- Creates ~175 new + ~50 updated links per week
- Focus: Strengthening existing network

---

## Special Linking Scenarios

### Pillar Article Linking
**In Pillar Articles:**
- Link to 10-15 cluster articles
- Organize links by subtopic
- Use descriptive anchors
- Create "Related Reading" boxes

**To Pillar Articles:**
- Cluster posts should link back to pillar
- Use varied anchors (not all "pillar post")
- Link naturally in context, not forced

### Series/Sequential Content
If creating a series (e.g., "Part 1, Part 2, Part 3"):
- Each post links to previous/next
- All link to series landing page
- Use clear "Part X of Y" formatting

### Seasonal/Timely Content
- Link to evergreen related content
- Update annually with current data
- Previous year's version links to new version

---

## Metrics to Track

### Internal Link Health
- Average internal links per post: Target 5-8
- Orphan pages (0 internal links): Target 0
- Pages with excessive links (15+): Minimize
- Broken internal links: Target 0

### Link Distribution
- Service page link coverage: 60%+ of posts
- Pillar page incoming links: 10+ per pillar
- New post discovery time: Under 7 days

### User Engagement
- Pages per session: Improvement over time
- Bounce rate: Decrease over time
- Time on site: Increase over time
