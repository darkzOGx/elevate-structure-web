## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I really get a structural engineer the same day in Costa Mesa?

Yes, we provide same-day service when availability permits. Call early in the day for best same-day availability. We maintain capacity for urgent needs and can typically accommodate same-day requests made by early afternoon. We'll always be honest about what's possible.

### What's included in a same-day structural assessment?

Same-day assessment includes site visit by a licensed PE, visual evaluation of your structural concern, professional opinion on conditions observed, verbal findings and recommendations, and follow-up written documentation if needed (typically 24-72 hours).

### How is same-day service different from emergency service?

Same-day service addresses urgent but non-emergency needs—real estate deadlines, construction questions, peace-of-mind assessments. Emergency service is for imminent safety issues—building damage, red tags, structural failures. We provide both; emergency situations take priority.

### How much notice do you need for same-day service?

Call as early as possible. Morning calls typically allow same-day afternoon visits. Afternoon calls may be accommodated same-day or next-morning depending on schedule. We'll give you honest expectations when you call.

### Do you provide written reports the same day?

Verbal findings are provided same-day. Written reports typically take 24-72 hours for proper documentation. Rush written reports may be available for additional fees. We'll discuss your timeline needs and what's achievable.

### What if same-day isn't available when I need it?

If same-day isn't possible, we'll offer the earliest available appointment—often next business day. For true emergencies with safety concerns, we prioritize immediate response. We're committed to meeting your needs as quickly as possible.
