## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can a structural engineer respond to an emergency in Newport Beach?

We typically respond same-day for urgent situations, often within 2-4 hours for imminent safety concerns. Response time depends on current demand and your specific situation. Call our emergency line and describe your situation for an accurate response estimate.

### What does emergency structural assessment include?

Emergency assessment includes site visit by a licensed PE, visual inspection of structural damage, preliminary safety determination, verbal report with immediate recommendations, and follow-up written documentation. We identify what's safe, what's dangerous, and what needs repair.

### How do I get a red tag removed from my Newport Beach property?

Red tag removal requires engineering assessment of the structural deficiencies that caused the tag, design of repairs to address those deficiencies, permit approval for the repairs, completion of the repairs, and final inspection. We guide you through this entire process.

### Will my insurance cover emergency structural engineering?

Most homeowner policies cover structural engineering as part of damage assessment for covered events (fire, vehicle impact, storms). We provide documentation formatted for insurance claims. Check your policy or call your agent to confirm coverage before or after your assessment.

### What's the difference between emergency assessment and a full structural report?

Emergency assessment provides rapid safety determination—is the building safe to occupy? A full structural report provides detailed documentation of conditions, analysis, and recommendations. Emergency assessment gets you answers immediately; full reports support insurance claims and repair permits.

### Should I call a contractor or an engineer first after structural damage?

Call an engineer first. Contractors can make repairs, but only a licensed engineer can assess structural safety, determine appropriate repairs, and provide the PE-stamped documentation needed for permits and insurance. Some contractors may recommend inadequate repairs without proper engineering.
