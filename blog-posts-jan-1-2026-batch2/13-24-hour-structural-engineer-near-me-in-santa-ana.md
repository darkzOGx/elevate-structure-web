## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you really answer calls 24 hours a day?

Yes. Our main number reaches our emergency response system after hours. A licensed PE will return your call to assess your situation and determine appropriate response. True emergencies receive priority callback and response.

### What's the difference between 24 hour and same-day service?

24 hour service means we're available around the clock, including nights, weekends, and holidays. Same-day service means we can see you today during business hours. 24 hour service is for situations that can't wait for business hours.

### How quickly can you respond to a Santa Ana emergency?

Response time depends on the situation and when you call. For true emergencies, we respond as quickly as safely possible—often within hours. For less urgent after-hours needs, we may schedule for early next morning. We assess each situation to provide appropriate response.

### Are there extra fees for after-hours service?

After-hours, night, and holiday services may include a premium of 25-50% over standard rates, reflecting the availability and rapid response provided. Weekend scheduled visits during reasonable hours often have minimal or no premium. We'll discuss fees before proceeding.

### What should I do while waiting for the engineer?

If there's any question about safety, stay out of the building. Document conditions with photos from safe distances. Do not attempt repairs. Keep people away from potentially unsafe areas. If immediate danger exists, call 911 first, then call us.

### Can you help with insurance claims for after-hours incidents?

Yes, we provide documentation formatted for insurance claims. After-hours incidents often require professional assessment for claim support. We document conditions, provide opinions on damage cause, and support your claim process.
