## Opening: Why Restaurant Structural Engineering in Pasadena Demands Specialized Expertise

Pasadena's culinary scene is one of the most vibrant in the San Gabriel Valley, with hundreds of restaurants operating in building stock that ranges from early 20th-century Craftsman-era commercial structures to modern mixed-use developments along Colorado Boulevard. When a restaurateur opens, expands, or remodels a dining establishment in Pasadena, the structural engineering challenges are uniquely demanding — far beyond what a typical tenant improvement project requires.

The City of Pasadena enforces the 2022 California Building Code (CBC) with local amendments, and the building department applies rigorous plan check standards to commercial food service operations. Kitchen equipment weights, rooftop exhaust systems, grease duct penetrations, and open-plan dining layouts all create structural demands that require input from California-licensed Professional Engineers (PE) before permits are issued.

AAA Engineering Design has completed 500+ commercial projects across Southern California over 20+ years of practice. Our team delivers structurally sound, code-compliant restaurant designs that pass Pasadena plan check and stand up to the seismic demands of the greater Los Angeles region. Call (949) 981-4448 for a same-day consultation.

## What Is Restaurant Structural Engineering?

Restaurant structural engineering is the discipline of analyzing and designing the load-carrying systems — foundations, floor slabs, columns, beams, and roof structures — specifically to support the unique demands of food service operations. Unlike standard office tenant improvements, restaurants impose concentrated loads from refrigeration units, walk-in coolers, commercial ranges, pizza ovens, and wood-fired hearths. Rooftop makeup air units (MAUs) and exhaust hood fans add significant distributed and point loads to roof framing systems.

In Pasadena, restaurant structural engineering also encompasses:

**Code Compliance Analysis.** The 2022 CBC defines occupancy classifications (A-2 for restaurants), live load requirements (100 psf for assembly areas with fixed seats, 100-125 psf for dining areas), and seismic design requirements specific to the Pasadena geologic environment.

**Existing Structure Assessment.** Many Pasadena restaurant spaces occupy historic buildings — 1920s brick commercial structures, 1940s stucco storefronts — that require careful assessment before any modification. Our engineers perform structural condition reports before every permit submittal.

**Kitchen Equipment Layout Coordination.** A commercial kitchen running at full capacity may have 60,000-120,000 BTU ranges, 500-pound floor mixers, walk-in refrigeration systems, and fire suppression overhead — all of which must be coordinated with structural framing below and MEP systems above.

**Open Floor Plan Design.** The trend toward open, airy dining spaces in Pasadena restaurants frequently requires removing interior walls or columns that carry gravity loads. Structural engineers design replacement beams (often steel wide-flange sections) and new point-load transfer paths to maintain structural integrity.

## Types of Restaurant Structural Engineering Services in Pasadena

### 1. New Construction Structural Design

For ground-up restaurant construction in Pasadena, our engineers design the complete lateral force resisting system (LFRS), gravity system, foundation, and slab-on-grade. Pasadena sits in a high seismic hazard zone — Seismic Design Category D — which requires special moment resisting frames (SMRF) or shear walls with specific detailing per AISC 341 and ACI 318.

New restaurant construction in Pasadena typically requires:
- Geotechnical investigation (soils report) for foundation design
- Structural calculations package (50-150 pages)
- Title 24 coordination for energy compliance
- DSA coordination if the project involves any public school or state-regulated occupancy adjacency

Engineering fees for new construction: $15,000–$25,000 depending on square footage and structural system complexity.

### 2. Tenant Improvement Structural Engineering

The majority of Pasadena restaurant projects are tenant improvements (TIs) — converting an existing commercial space into a restaurant or remodeling an existing restaurant. TI structural scope typically includes:

- Wall removal analysis and replacement header/beam design
- New kitchen equipment pad and anchorage design
- Rooftop equipment structural support (curbs, dunnage frames)
- Hood and grease duct penetration framing
- ADA ramp and accessible route structural modifications
- Restroom addition or relocation structural framing

TI engineering fees in Pasadena: $5,000–$15,000.

### 3. Commercial Kitchen Structural Engineering

The commercial kitchen is the structural heart of a restaurant. In Pasadena, a full-service restaurant kitchen commonly requires:

**Floor Load Analysis.** Commercial kitchen floors must support live loads of 100–150 psf. A 10-foot by 20-foot walk-in cooler with product weight can impose 300–400 psf on the floor structure below. Our engineers verify existing slab and framing capacity and specify reinforcement or new slab sections where required.

**Equipment Anchorage.** California seismic codes require positive anchorage of commercial kitchen equipment heavier than 400 pounds. Our engineers specify anchor bolt patterns, embed plates, and restraint systems that meet CBC Section 1613 and ASCE 7-22 seismic anchorage requirements.

**Rooftop Hood Systems.** A Type I commercial hood system serving a line of ranges produces grease-laden exhaust that must travel through a fire-rated shaft from kitchen to roof. The structural penetration through roof framing — often a 24-inch by 36-inch opening or larger — requires engineered framing around the opening and structural support for the rooftop exhaust fan (typically 300–800 pounds).

### 4. Seismic Retrofit for Existing Restaurant Buildings

Pasadena has an active soft-story and unreinforced masonry (URM) retrofit program. Many older buildings that house restaurants require mandatory seismic retrofit before the City issues permits for significant improvements. Our engineers perform:

- Soft-story evaluation per ASCE 41-17
- URM anchorage and out-of-plane wall bracing design
- Cripple wall bracing for wood-frame restaurant buildings
- Steel moment frame or plywood shear wall retrofit design

### 5. ADA Structural Modifications

California's Division of State Architect (DSA) ADA requirements mandate accessible routes, restroom configurations, and entrance ramp geometry that frequently require structural modifications. In Pasadena, older restaurant buildings often have raised entry vestibules, split-level dining areas, and non-compliant restroom partitions. Our engineers design:

- Entry ramp structural pads and footings
- Floor level changes and ramp framing
- Accessible restroom partition framing
- Elevated dining platform structural systems

## Pasadena Geographic and Regulatory Considerations

### Seismic Environment

Pasadena is located approximately 5 miles from the Raymond Fault and within the influence zone of the Sierra Madre Fault system. The USGS seismic hazard maps classify Pasadena in a high ground motion zone with Ss values (short-period spectral acceleration) of 1.8–2.1g. This places most Pasadena restaurants in Seismic Design Category D (SDC D), which triggers:

- Special inspection requirements for welding, bolting, concrete, and masonry
- Seismic design of nonstructural components (equipment anchorage, ceiling systems, glass partitions)
- Diaphragm continuity requirements for open floor plan layouts

### Pasadena Building Department

The City of Pasadena Building and Safety Division processes commercial restaurant permits through its standard Plan Check process. Key facts for restaurant projects:

- Plan check turnaround: 6–10 weeks for over-the-counter plan check; 3–4 weeks for electronic plan check
- Structural plans must bear the wet stamp and signature of a California-licensed PE or SE
- The City requires a soils report for new foundations deeper than 12 inches
- Mechanical permits (for hood systems) are processed simultaneously with structural permits
- The City enforces the 2022 CBC, 2022 CMC, 2022 CFC, and local Pasadena Municipal Code amendments

### Soil Conditions

Pasadena's geology varies significantly across its boundaries. The lower-elevation areas along the 210 Freeway corridor sit on alluvial fan deposits — generally favorable for conventional spread footings. Higher-elevation areas in the Altadena border zone can encounter expansive soils or shallow bedrock. Restaurants in historic downtown Pasadena (Old Town) are frequently built on fill or compacted rubble from early 20th-century construction, which requires careful geotechnical evaluation before any new foundation work.

### Historic Building Stock

Old Town Pasadena and the South Lake Avenue commercial corridor contain numerous buildings constructed between 1910 and 1950, many listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Pasadena Historic Register. Restaurant improvements in these buildings require coordination with the City's Historic Preservation staff and may be subject to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Structural interventions must minimize visual impact while achieving code compliance — a balance our engineers navigate on every historic commercial project.

## Restaurant Structural Engineering Costs in Pasadena

Engineering fees for restaurant structural work in Pasadena depend on three primary factors: the scope of structural work, the complexity of the existing structure, and the extent of seismic compliance required.

| Project Type | Typical Engineering Fee |
|---|---|
| Hood/equipment penetration only | $2,500–$5,000 |
| TI with wall removals + kitchen | $7,500–$15,000 |
| Full restaurant TI with seismic | $12,000–$20,000 |
| New construction (ground-up) | $18,000–$25,000 |
| Seismic retrofit + TI combined | $15,000–$25,000 |

These fees cover structural calculations, construction documents, plan check coordination, and response to City comments. Most Pasadena plan check cycles generate 1–2 correction rounds; AAA Engineering Design includes plan check correction response in our standard fee.

Note: Geotechnical investigation (soils report) is a separate cost, typically $4,000–$8,000 for a Pasadena restaurant site.

Construction costs for the structural work itself — not engineering — typically run 3–8x the engineering fee, depending on whether steel, concrete, or wood framing is used.

## Common Structural Challenges in Pasadena Restaurants

### Challenge 1: Existing Slab Capacity for Walk-In Coolers

Pasadena's older commercial buildings were designed for retail or office live loads of 50–80 psf. A walk-in cooler installed on an existing concrete slab may exceed the slab's original design capacity. Our engineers core-drill the slab to determine thickness, pull rebar size from the original permit drawings (if available), and run a capacity analysis. When the slab is deficient, we specify either a new structural slab section or a spread-load platform to distribute the cooler weight.

### Challenge 2: Open Floor Plan Column Removal

Pasadena's classic commercial buildings often feature 20-foot bay spacing supported by interior columns. Restaurant operators want open dining rooms — which means those columns must go. Removing a column requires designing a replacement beam (often a W18 or W21 wide-flange steel section) to span the full bay width and transfer gravity loads to adjacent columns or new foundations. The new beam connections must also be designed for the seismic load path, which in SDC D requires careful attention to collector elements and diaphragm continuity.

### Challenge 3: Rooftop HVAC and Hood Fan Weight

A Type I hood system serving a six-burner range line requires a 3,000–5,000 CFM exhaust fan on the roof. These fans weigh 300–600 pounds and must be mounted on a structural curb that is positively anchored to the roof framing. In Pasadena's older buildings, roof framing is typically 2x6 or 2x8 rafters at 24 inches on center — not designed for concentrated rooftop equipment loads. Our engineers design steel dunnage frames, sister-rafter reinforcement, or new structural curb assemblies to safely carry rooftop kitchen equipment.

### Challenge 4: Grease Duct Fire-Rated Shaft Construction

California Fire Code and NFPA 96 require Type I grease ducts to be enclosed in a 1-hour or 2-hour fire-rated shaft from the kitchen ceiling to the roof. Building that shaft through existing floor or roof framing requires structural framing around the duct opening — typically a doubled header and trimmer system analogous to stair framing. In Pasadena's historic buildings, creating this shaft without damaging original plaster ceilings or character-defining features requires close coordination between the structural engineer, mechanical engineer, and the City's Historic Preservation office.

### Challenge 5: ADA Ramp Integration in Historic Storefronts

Many Pasadena restaurant storefronts have a raised entry threshold — 4 to 8 inches above the public sidewalk — that creates an ADA access barrier. The accessible route solution is an entry ramp, but in a historic building the ramp must be designed to avoid permanent alteration of character-defining features. Our engineers design removable or reversible ramp systems with concrete footings that satisfy both ADA and historic preservation requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions: Restaurant Structural Engineering in Pasadena

### 1. Does a restaurant remodel in Pasadena always require a structural engineer?

Any Pasadena restaurant remodel that involves wall removal, new rooftop equipment, changes to the foundation, or modifications to the structural frame requires stamped structural engineering drawings from a California-licensed PE. Simple cosmetic work — paint, flooring, booth replacement — does not. When in doubt, contact the Pasadena Building and Safety Division at (626) 744-4200 to determine whether a permit is required.

### 2. How long does it take to get a restaurant structural permit in Pasadena?

The Pasadena building department processes structural plan checks in 6–10 weeks for standard submissions, or 3–4 weeks through electronic plan check for eligible projects. AAA Engineering Design prepares complete, code-compliant submittal packages that minimize correction rounds. Most of our Pasadena restaurant projects achieve permit issuance in 8–12 weeks from the first submittal.

### 3. What live loads must a commercial kitchen floor support in Pasadena?

The 2022 California Building Code classifies commercial kitchen floors as a minimum 100 psf live load for the general floor area. Walk-in coolers and freezers impose additional concentrated loads from the unit weight plus product storage — often 200–400 psf locally. Our engineers verify existing slab capacity and specify reinforcement or load distribution platforms where needed.

### 4. Is earthquake retrofitting required before opening a restaurant in Pasadena?

Pasadena's mandatory retrofit programs target soft-story wood-frame buildings (buildings with a weak or open first story) and unreinforced masonry buildings. If your restaurant occupies one of these building types and the project triggers a mandatory retrofit threshold, the City requires retrofit completion before issuing a certificate of occupancy. Our engineers evaluate your building's classification and advise on retrofit requirements and costs before you sign a lease.

### 5. What is the cost to engineer an open floor plan with column removal in a Pasadena restaurant?

Column removal structural engineering in a Pasadena restaurant typically costs $3,500–$8,000 for engineering services, depending on the number of columns removed, the bay span, and the complexity of the seismic load path. Construction costs for the replacement steel beam and connections are separate — typically $8,000–$20,000 per column removal depending on span and access conditions.

### 6. Do hood exhaust systems require separate structural permits in Pasadena?

The mechanical permit for a Type I commercial hood system is separate from the structural permit in Pasadena, but both are required. The structural engineer documents the rooftop exhaust fan support and the framed opening through the roof structure on the structural drawings. The mechanical engineer documents the hood, duct, and fan specifications on the mechanical drawings. Both permit sets are submitted simultaneously to the Pasadena Building and Safety Division.

### 7. How does AAA Engineering Design handle ADA structural requirements for Pasadena restaurants?

Our engineers coordinate ADA structural modifications with the architectural plans to ensure the accessible route, restroom configurations, and entry ramp geometry all meet California Building Code Title 24 accessibility requirements. For historic Pasadena buildings, we design reversible or minimally invasive ramp systems that comply with both ADA and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.

### 8. What is the seismic design category for restaurants in Pasadena?

Most restaurants in Pasadena are classified as Seismic Design Category D (SDC D) under ASCE 7-22, based on the City's high ground motion values and the assembly occupancy classification (Risk Category II). SDC D triggers special seismic detailing requirements for the structural frame, diaphragms, and nonstructural component anchorage — including kitchen equipment, suspended ceilings, and glass partitions.

## Restaurant Structural Engineering Project Timeline in Pasadena

Understanding the typical timeline for a Pasadena restaurant structural engineering project helps owners and operators plan lease commencement, equipment procurement, and contractor mobilization. Here is a realistic timeline for a mid-scale restaurant tenant improvement:

**Week 1–2: Engagement and Site Assessment**
Following your call to (949) 981-4448, AAA Engineering Design issues a 48-hour written fee proposal. Upon engagement, our engineers conduct a site assessment visit to document existing structural conditions — slab thickness, framing system type, column locations, rooftop conditions, and existing mechanical penetrations. We obtain available permit drawings from the City of Pasadena Records Division to supplement our field observations.

**Week 2–4: Structural Analysis and Design**
Our engineers perform structural analysis of the existing system, design replacement beams and headers for any wall removals, design rooftop equipment supports, and develop the kitchen equipment anchorage layout. For projects requiring seismic compliance review, this phase includes lateral system assessment per ASCE 41-17 Tier 1 screening.

**Week 4–6: Construction Documents**
We produce the full structural drawing set — foundation plan, floor framing plan, roof framing plan, structural sections and details, and the project structural specifications. Documents are coordinated with the architect's and mechanical engineer's drawings before submittal.

**Week 6–16: Plan Check and Permit Issuance**
The Pasadena Building and Safety Division reviews the structural documents over 6–10 weeks. Our engineers respond to plan check correction comments within 48 hours of receipt. Most Pasadena restaurant projects achieve permit issuance within 10–14 weeks of the first submittal.

**Construction Phase: Ongoing Structural Observation**
After permit issuance, our engineers are available for construction observation visits, RFI (request for information) responses, and special inspection coordination. Pasadena's SDC D classification requires special inspections for welding, high-strength bolting, and concrete placement — we coordinate these inspection services with our clients' general contractors.

Understanding this timeline is essential for Pasadena restaurateurs who are negotiating lease terms, planning contractor bid packages, and coordinating with equipment vendors. Our team's experience with the Pasadena plan check process allows us to set realistic expectations and identify accelerated paths when your schedule demands it.

## Special Considerations for Pasadena Restaurant Conversions

Pasadena presents a unique concentration of older commercial buildings — many of them architecturally significant — that are prime candidates for restaurant conversion. Former banks, retail anchors, and office buildings in Old Town Pasadena and the South Lake Avenue corridor are regularly adapted for restaurant use. These conversion projects present structural challenges that new construction projects do not:

**Existing Slab Penetrations.** Former retail buildings in Pasadena typically have minimal slab penetrations — no floor drains, no grease trap access ports, no plumbing rough-in. Converting these spaces to restaurant use requires saw-cutting and patching the existing concrete slab for new plumbing, grease trap installation, and floor drain layout. Our engineers specify the saw-cut locations, reinforcement at cut edges, and patch concrete specifications to maintain slab structural integrity.

**Existing Structural Bay Conflicts.** Pasadena's classic 1920s commercial buildings were designed with structural bay spacings of 18–22 feet — appropriate for retail shelving layouts but not ideal for restaurant kitchen equipment rows, which require specific clearances for hood systems, cooking equipment, and fire suppression. Our engineers develop creative framing solutions that work within the existing column grid while satisfying the kitchen designer's layout requirements.

**Mechanical Shaft Coordination in Historic Buildings.** Creating a new grease duct shaft through an existing historic building in Pasadena requires routing the duct through the path of least architectural impact. Our engineers work with the architect and the City's Historic Preservation staff to identify shaft routing that avoids character-defining ceiling ornament, decorative plasterwork, and original storefront elements — while still meeting NFPA 96 requirements for the duct system.

**Existing Foundation Capacity for New Loads.** A Pasadena restaurant converting from retail use will add significant new gravity loads: walk-in coolers, commercial ranges, hood systems, grease interceptors. Our engineers assess whether the existing foundation system — typically spread footings on alluvial soils — has adequate capacity for the new loads, or whether localized foundation strengthening is required.

These conversion challenges are where experienced restaurant structural engineers earn their fees. Identifying structural constraints early in the design process prevents costly redesigns and construction delays — and in historic Pasadena buildings, prevents irreversible damage to buildings that the community values.
