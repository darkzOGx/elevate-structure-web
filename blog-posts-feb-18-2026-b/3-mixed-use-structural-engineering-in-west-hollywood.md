## Opening: Mixed-Use Structural Engineering in West Hollywood's Urban Development Landscape

West Hollywood is one of the densest, most design-forward municipalities in Southern California. The City's 1.9 square miles encompass thousands of residential units above street-level retail along Sunset Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and San Vicente Boulevard — a concentrated urban fabric that generates constant demand for mixed-use structural engineering expertise. Whether it is a new five-story podium development replacing a surface parking lot, a soft-story retrofit mandated by the City's ordinance, or a residential-over-retail building undergoing seismic rehabilitation, structural engineering in West Hollywood demands a specialist's understanding of its regulatory environment, building typology, and seismic exposure.

The City of West Hollywood enforces the 2022 California Building Code with local amendments and runs one of the most active mandatory soft-story retrofit programs in Southern California. Its building department — the West Hollywood Building and Safety Division — reviews mixed-use structural submittals with thoroughness that demands complete, code-compliant engineering documentation. California-licensed Professional Engineers (PE) are required on every structural submittal.

AAA Engineering Design brings 500+ completed commercial and residential projects over 20+ years of practice to every West Hollywood engagement. Our California-licensed engineers understand podium construction, soft-story retrofit, and the structural challenges unique to West Hollywood's mixed-use building stock.

## What Is Mixed-Use Structural Engineering?

Mixed-use structural engineering addresses buildings that combine two or more occupancy types — most commonly ground-floor retail or commercial space (Business or Mercantile occupancy) beneath two to five floors of residential units (Residential occupancy). The structural engineering challenges of mixed-use buildings arise from:

**Occupancy Transitions.** The structural system must transition between the column grid appropriate for open retail spans on the ground floor (often 25–40 feet on center) and the bearing wall or shear wall layout appropriate for residential floors above. This transition — the podium-to-wood-frame interface — is one of the most critical structural details in mixed-use design.

**Lateral System Discontinuity.** Ground-floor retail requires open facades with large glass storefronts and minimal interior walls. Residential floors above have dense wall layouts. This creates a vertical discontinuity in the lateral force resisting system — the ground story is weaker and more flexible than the stories above, producing the classic "soft story" condition that causes catastrophic building collapse in earthquakes.

**Different Live Loads by Floor.** Ground-floor retail imposes live loads of 75–100 psf. Residential floors are designed for 40 psf. Mechanical penthouse levels may require 100–150 psf. The structural system must accommodate these load transitions across the building height.

**Seismic Performance Objectives.** Mixed-use buildings in West Hollywood typically house permanent residential occupants above commercial activity. The 2022 CBC and the City's local amendments set minimum seismic performance requirements; many West Hollywood developers choose to exceed the minimum to achieve better occupancy and financing outcomes.

## Types of Mixed-Use Structural Engineering Services in West Hollywood

### 1. New Podium Construction Structural Design

Podium construction is the dominant mixed-use building typology in West Hollywood: a concrete podium deck (typically the second-floor slab) with one or two levels of concrete or steel structure below (parking or retail) and two to four levels of wood-frame residential construction above. Structural engineering for a new West Hollywood podium building involves:

**Podium Concrete Design.** The podium deck is the structural interface between the below-grade concrete world and the above-grade wood-frame world. It typically uses post-tensioned flat plate construction with slab thickness of 9–12 inches, designed to carry the wood-frame residential loads above and to cantilever over the retail bays below. Our engineers design the post-tensioned system, tendon layout, column caps, and edge conditions.

**Below-Podium Concrete Frame.** The ground-floor and basement levels use reinforced concrete columns and shear walls designed as a special reinforced concrete shear wall system (ACI 318, SDC D requirements). West Hollywood's seismic environment — close to the Hollywood Fault — drives high lateral design demands on the below-podium concrete frame.

**Wood-Frame Residential Above Podium.** The residential stories use Type V-A or Type III-A wood-frame construction with plywood shear walls. The shear wall layout in the residential stories must align with the concrete shear wall or moment frame elements below, creating a continuous lateral load path from roof to foundation.

**Foundation Design.** West Hollywood's urban density means most podium sites have property line constraints that limit foundation options. Mat foundations or interconnected spread footings with grade beams are the most common solutions for West Hollywood podium buildings.

### 2. Soft-Story Retrofit Structural Engineering

West Hollywood adopted a mandatory soft-story retrofit ordinance in 2017. The ordinance targets wood-frame multistory buildings with a weak or open ground story — typically a ground-floor tuck-under garage beneath apartments — that are highly vulnerable to collapse in earthquakes. The West Hollywood ordinance requires all applicable buildings to be retrofit-compliant by specific deadlines.

Our soft-story retrofit services for West Hollywood include:

**Screening and Classification.** We review existing building plans and conduct site investigations to determine whether a building meets the definition of a soft-story building under the West Hollywood ordinance and applicable guidelines (LADBS Ordinance 183893 and associated technical bulletins, which West Hollywood adopts by reference).

**Retrofit Design.** Standard soft-story retrofit approaches include:
- **Steel moment frames** installed in the garage opening bays to provide lateral stiffness and strength without blocking vehicle access
- **Plywood shear walls** added at available locations within the soft story
- **Combination systems** using moment frames and shear walls together for the most efficient structural solution

**Construction Documents.** Our engineers produce complete structural drawings and specifications for the soft-story retrofit, coordinated with architectural and MEP documents for simultaneous permit submittal.

**Plan Check Support.** West Hollywood's Building and Safety Division reviews soft-story retrofit submittals against specific technical criteria. Our engineers respond to plan check comments efficiently, drawing on our experience with multiple West Hollywood retrofit projects.

### 3. Residential-Over-Retail Structural Remodeling

Existing West Hollywood mixed-use buildings frequently undergo significant tenant improvement or ownership change that triggers structural review. Common scopes include:

- Ground-floor retail demising wall removal for new tenant open-plan configurations
- Residential unit combination requiring load-bearing wall removal
- Rooftop deck addition for penthouse residential units
- New mechanical equipment structural support on the rooftop
- ADA accessible route improvements at the building entry

Our engineers assess existing structural conditions, evaluate the impact of proposed changes on the lateral and gravity load paths, and produce engineered drawings that satisfy West Hollywood's plan check requirements.

### 4. Seismic Evaluation and Voluntary Upgrade

Beyond the mandatory soft-story program, many West Hollywood mixed-use building owners pursue voluntary seismic upgrade to improve property value, reduce earthquake damage risk, and support lease-up of residential units to seismically conscious tenants. Our engineers perform:

- Seismic evaluation per ASCE 41-17 (Tier 1 and Tier 2 assessments)
- Performance-based seismic evaluation targeting Life Safety or Immediate Occupancy objectives
- Voluntary retrofit design using moment frames, buckling-restrained braces, or viscous dampers
- Seismic isolation feasibility studies for high-value West Hollywood properties

## West Hollywood Geographic and Regulatory Considerations

### Seismic Environment

West Hollywood sits between two active fault systems: the Hollywood Fault (approximately 1–2 miles north) and the Wilshire Fault Zone (approximately 1 mile south). The USGS National Seismic Hazard Model assigns West Hollywood spectral acceleration values of Ss = 2.0–2.4g (0.2-second period) — among the highest values in Southern California. This places virtually all West Hollywood mixed-use buildings in Seismic Design Category D (SDC D), with some Risk Category III structures in SDC E.

The proximity of the Hollywood Fault means West Hollywood buildings are subject to near-fault seismic effects — pulse-type ground motions with high velocity demands that are more damaging to buildings than standard far-field ground shaking. ASCE 7-22 accounts for near-fault effects through its site-specific ground motion procedure, which our engineers apply when required.

### West Hollywood Building and Safety Division

The West Hollywood Building and Safety Division processes structural permits for all commercial and mixed-use projects. Key facts:

- Plan check turnaround: 6–10 weeks for over-the-counter submittals; 3–5 weeks for electronic submittals
- Structural plans must bear the wet stamp of a California-licensed PE or SE
- Soft-story retrofit submittals are processed through a separate soft-story retrofit permit track
- The City enforces the 2022 CBC and the West Hollywood Municipal Code (including local seismic amendments)
- The City has an active Green Building (WEHO Zero Waste) program that applies to new construction

### Hollywood Fault Alquist-Priolo Zone

Portions of West Hollywood — particularly the northern areas near Sunset Boulevard — fall within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone for the Hollywood Fault. New buildings for human occupancy within the Alquist-Priolo zone require a site-specific geologic investigation to confirm the building footprint is at least 50 feet from the active fault trace. Our engineers coordinate with geotechnical firms experienced in Hollywood Fault investigations for West Hollywood projects in the fault zone.

### Soil Conditions

West Hollywood's subsurface conditions are dominated by Quaternary alluvial deposits with varying depth to bedrock. The central West Hollywood area (Santa Monica Boulevard corridor) has moderate-bearing-capacity alluvial soils suitable for conventional spread footings for low-rise mixed-use buildings. The Sunset Strip area (northern WeHo) has shallower alluvium over marine terrace or bedrock that can produce beneficial site conditions. The low-lying areas near Beverly Boulevard can have softer soils with higher seismic amplification.

### Density Bonus and TOD Context

West Hollywood has aggressive density bonus and transit-oriented development policies that drive intense mixed-use development along its major corridors. Many WeHo mixed-use projects involve 5–7 story buildings at or near property lines, requiring careful attention to:

- Shoring and underpinning design for adjacent property protection
- Structural system selection for narrow, irregular footprints
- Rooftop amenity deck structural design (pool decks, garden decks)
- Facade setback structural transitions at upper floors

| Soft-story retrofit (4-unit building) | $5,000–$8,000 |
| Soft-story retrofit (8-12 unit building) | $8,000–$15,000 |
| TI — ground-floor retail modification | $5,000–$10,000 |
| Residential unit combination (wall removal) | $4,000–$8,000 |
| Rooftop deck or penthouse addition | $8,000–$15,000 |
| New podium building (ground-up) | $25,000–$60,000+ |
| Seismic evaluation (Tier 1+2) | $6,000–$12,000 |

These fees cover structural calculations, construction documents, plan check submittal support, and one round of correction response. Geotechnical investigation, Alquist-Priolo geological investigation (if required), and special inspection coordination are additional.

Construction costs for structural retrofit and new construction in West Hollywood reflect the City's labor market and urban density: soft-story retrofits typically cost $30,000–$80,000 per building; new podium construction runs $150–$250 per square foot for the structural system alone.

## Common Structural Challenges in West Hollywood Mixed-Use Buildings

### Challenge 1: Lateral System Discontinuity — The Soft-Story Problem

The fundamental structural challenge in West Hollywood's existing mixed-use building stock is the soft-story condition. Buildings from the 1950s through the 1980s were routinely designed with open, glazed ground floors for retail and tuck-under garages for residential units — creating a ground story with dramatically less lateral stiffness and strength than the stories above. In the 1994 Northridge earthquake, hundreds of similar buildings in the Los Angeles area collapsed at the soft story, killing occupants in their beds. West Hollywood's mandatory retrofit ordinance exists to prevent this outcome in the next major earthquake.

Our engineers design soft-story retrofit systems that restore lateral strength and stiffness to the deficient ground story without eliminating the functionality that the ground floor serves. Steel moment frames installed in garage openings provide stiffness while maintaining vehicle access. Plywood shear walls added at interior garage walls provide strength without major disruption to the building's exterior appearance.

### Challenge 2: Podium-to-Wood-Frame Interface

In new podium construction, the interface between the concrete podium deck and the wood-frame residential structure above is one of the most detailed structural connections in mixed-use design. The wood-frame shear walls must transfer their lateral loads to the concrete podium through hold-down anchors and shear transfer elements — all of which must be carefully coordinated with the post-tensioned slab's tendon layout. Our engineers produce coordinated structural drawings that show every anchor location relative to the PT tendon positions, eliminating field conflicts that cause construction delays.

### Challenge 3: Ground-Floor Retail Open Facades

West Hollywood's retail culture demands transparent, open ground-floor storefronts — large glass windows and minimal structural elements at the sidewalk level. This creates a structural challenge: the ground floor must be strong enough to resist seismic forces, but architectural requirements preclude the solid shear walls that would most efficiently achieve this. Our engineers design slender steel special moment frames, glass storefront frames with seismic glazing, and concealed steel moment connections that meet both the structural demands of SDC D and the architectural vision of West Hollywood retail design.

### Challenge 4: Rooftop Amenity Decks on Older Residential-Over-Retail Buildings

West Hollywood's competitive residential rental market drives landlord investment in rooftop amenity decks — seating areas, gardens, and sometimes pools for residential tenants. Adding a rooftop amenity deck to a 1960s or 1970s mixed-use building requires structural assessment of the existing roof framing, design of a new structural deck system, and verification that the existing columns and foundations can carry the added dead and live loads. Pool decks impose live loads of 100–150 psf plus the water weight — a significant addition to a building designed for 20 psf roof live load.

### Challenge 5: Property-Line Construction Shoring

West Hollywood's urban density means most new mixed-use development occurs on sites with zero or minimal setbacks from adjacent buildings. Excavating for below-grade parking or crawl space requires engineered shoring systems — typically soldier pile and lagging or sheet pile walls — designed to protect adjacent structures from movement. Our engineers design shoring systems and monitor adjacent building performance during excavation in coordination with the geotechnical engineer of record.

## Frequently Asked Questions: Mixed-Use Structural Engineering in West Hollywood

### 1. Is my West Hollywood apartment building subject to the mandatory soft-story retrofit ordinance?

West Hollywood's mandatory soft-story retrofit ordinance applies to wood-frame multistory buildings with a soft, weak, or open ground story — typically tuck-under garage buildings — constructed before January 1, 1978. If your building received a notice from the City, it is subject to the ordinance. Even without a City notice, our engineers can screen your building to determine if it meets the ordinance's applicability criteria. Call (949) 981-4448 to schedule a screening.

### 2. What does a soft-story retrofit cost in West Hollywood?

Engineering fees for soft-story retrofit in West Hollywood range from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on building size and complexity. Construction costs for the structural retrofit work typically run $30,000 to $80,000 for a typical 8–12 unit building. The City of West Hollywood offers information on state-administered financing programs for soft-story retrofit; our engineers can connect you with these resources during the initial consultation.

### 3. What is podium construction and why is it used in West Hollywood?

Podium construction combines a concrete podium deck (typically at the second-floor level) with concrete or steel framing below (for parking or retail) and wood-frame residential construction above. It is the dominant new mixed-use building typology in West Hollywood because it allows the residential stories to use cost-effective wood framing while the ground level achieves the open spans and durable construction required for retail and parking. The concrete podium also provides a fire separation between the residential and commercial occupancies.

### 4. What seismic design requirements apply to mixed-use buildings in West Hollywood?

West Hollywood mixed-use buildings are in Seismic Design Category D (SDC D) per ASCE 7-22 for Risk Category II structures, based on the City's proximity to the Hollywood Fault and the associated high ground motion values. SDC D requires special structural systems (special moment frames or special reinforced concrete shear walls), comprehensive special inspection during construction, and seismic anchorage of nonstructural components including mechanical equipment and suspended ceilings.

### 5. Do I need a geologic investigation if my West Hollywood building is near the Hollywood Fault?

Yes. Properties within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone for the Hollywood Fault — which covers portions of West Hollywood along the northern boundary — require a site-specific geologic investigation for any new building for human occupancy. The investigation must demonstrate that the building footprint is at least 50 feet from the active fault trace. Our engineers coordinate with geotechnical firms experienced in Hollywood Fault investigations.

### 6. How long does West Hollywood plan check take for mixed-use structural projects?

West Hollywood's Building and Safety Division typically processes mixed-use structural plan checks in 6–10 weeks for standard over-the-counter submittals and 3–5 weeks for electronic submittals on eligible projects. Soft-story retrofit submittals are processed through a separate track and may be faster. AAA Engineering Design prepares complete, code-compliant structural packages that minimize correction cycles and plan check delays.

### 7. Can I add a rooftop pool deck to my West Hollywood mixed-use building?

Yes, with proper structural engineering. Adding a rooftop pool deck to an existing West Hollywood building requires a structural assessment of the existing roof framing, columns, and foundations to determine whether they can support the added loads (100–150 psf live load plus water weight). In many cases, the existing structure requires reinforcement — additional columns, stronger beams, or foundation upgrades — before the rooftop pool is feasible. Our engineers assess your specific building and provide a feasibility report before you commit to the design.

### 8. What structural system is used for soft-story retrofit in West Hollywood?

The most common soft-story retrofit approach in West Hollywood is the installation of steel special moment frames in the open garage bays of the soft story. Moment frames provide lateral stiffness and strength without blocking vehicle or pedestrian access. For buildings with available wall locations, plywood shear walls are a cost-effective supplement or alternative. The choice of system depends on the building's configuration, the severity of the soft-story deficiency, and the owner's budget. Our engineers evaluate all options and recommend the most efficient solution for each West Hollywood building.
