National City's active redevelopment and residential improvement market creates steady demand for engineering services. Whether you're adding an ADU, remodeling a kitchen, or developing commercial property, proper engineering documentation is often the key to permit approval.

## What Is a Permit Engineer?

**Direct Answer:**
A permit engineer is a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) who prepares structural calculations and drawings required for building permit applications. In California, PE-stamped plans are required when projects involve structural modifications, exceed prescriptive code limits, or when building officials determine engineering is necessary. Permit engineers design structural systems, prepare PE-stamped drawings, and often assist with plan check responses to ensure permit approval.

**Key Services:**

**Structural Analysis**
- Calculate loads and forces
- Design structural systems
- Ensure code compliance
- Address plan check comments

**Plan Preparation**
- Structural drawings
- Construction details
- Connection specifications
- PE stamp and signature

**Permit Support**
- Plan check responses
- Corrections and revisions
- Building official coordination

**Common Projects Requiring PE Stamps:**
- Room additions over 500 SF
- Second-story additions
- Load-bearing wall removal
- Deck and patio covers
- ADU construction
- Commercial tenant improvements
- Seismic retrofits
