## What Is ADU Structural Engineering?

ADU structural engineering is the professional design and documentation of structural systems for accessory dwelling units—secondary housing units on residential properties. Licensed Professional Engineers design foundations, framing, and structural connections while producing PE-stamped plans required for building permits.

California's landmark ADU legislation has made accessory dwelling units one of the most popular housing additions statewide, and Cathedral City's favorable climate makes ADUs particularly appealing for year-round guest accommodations, rental income, or multigenerational living.

ADU structural engineers handle various project types including detached new construction ADUs, garage conversions, attached additions, and above-garage units. Each type presents different structural requirements addressed through professional engineering.

## What ADU Types Can Engineers Design in Cathedral City?

Structural engineers design all ADU configurations permitted under California law and Cathedral City regulations.

**Detached ADUs**

Stand-alone structures separate from the primary residence:
- New construction from the ground up
- Foundation design for desert soils
