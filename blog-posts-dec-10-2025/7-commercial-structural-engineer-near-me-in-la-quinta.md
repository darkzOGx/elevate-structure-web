## What Does a Commercial Structural Engineer Do?

A commercial structural engineer analyzes, designs, and documents structural systems for non-residential buildings—offices, retail centers, restaurants, hotels, and industrial facilities. Licensed Professional Engineers ensure commercial structures safely support all loads while meeting California Building Code and accessibility requirements.
