## What Is Tenant Improvement Engineering and When Is It Needed?

**Direct Answer:**
Tenant improvement engineering provides structural design for modifications to commercial spaces, including wall removals, opening enlargements, mezzanine additions, and equipment support. In Costa Mesa, where the City requires PE-stamped plans for structural modifications, engineering is essential for permit approval when TI projects involve load-bearing elements, new openings, or changes affecting building structure.

Not every TI requires engineering. Cosmetic improvements, furniture installation, and minor finish work typically don't need structural plans. However, any modification affecting the building's structural system—removing walls, creating openings, adding significant loads—requires professional engineering.
