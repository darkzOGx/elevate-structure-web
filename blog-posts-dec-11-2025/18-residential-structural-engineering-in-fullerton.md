## What Is Residential Structural Engineering and When Do You Need It?

**Direct Answer:**
Residential structural engineering provides professional design and analysis for home structures, ensuring safety, code compliance, and permit approval for construction projects. In Fullerton, where the City requires engineering for additions, significant remodels, and structural modifications, PE-stamped plans are essential for permit approval and construction of projects from simple room additions to major renovations.

Not every home improvement requires engineering. Cosmetic updates, simple repairs, and minor projects typically don't need structural plans. However, any project affecting load-bearing walls, adding living space, or modifying the structural system requires professional engineering.
