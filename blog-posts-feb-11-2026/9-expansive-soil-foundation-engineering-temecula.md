<aside class="answer-capsule" data-speakable="true"><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Expansive soil foundation engineering in Temecula designs foundations that resist damage from the city's notorious clay soils. Licensed engineers specify post-tension slabs, deepened footings, moisture barriers, and drainage systems tailored to Temecula's high-expansion soils, typically costing $4,000-$20,000 for engineering design.</aside>

Expansive soil foundation engineering in Temecula addresses the single most destructive geological condition affecting homes throughout the Temecula Valley. With a population of approximately 114,000 and a median home value of $640,000, Temecula is one of Riverside County's premier residential communities — and one of Southern California's most challenging environments for residential foundations. The montmorillonite clay soils underlying much of Temecula expand dramatically when wet and shrink when dry, exerting tremendous forces on foundations that were not engineered to resist this movement. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers (PE) design foundation systems specifically engineered for Temecula's expansive soil conditions, delivering PE-stamped plans that prevent the cracking, heaving, and settlement that plague improperly designed foundations in the region.

Temecula's wine country setting, excellent schools, and master-planned communities drive active residential construction. Every new home, addition, and renovation in Temecula requires a foundation designed to handle the reality of expansive soils. This guide explains what expansive soils are and why they damage foundations, the engineering solutions available for Temecula properties, the design process, regional considerations, and realistic cost expectations.

## What Is Expansive Soil Foundation Engineering?

Expansive soil foundation engineering is the specialized practice of designing foundation systems that accommodate or resist the volume changes caused by expansive clay soils. When clay soils absorb moisture, they swell — in some cases increasing in volume by 10-15%. When they dry, they shrink by a comparable amount. This cyclical expansion and contraction exerts forces on foundations that can crack concrete, distort structural framing, and render a home's doors, windows, and finishes inoperable.

In Temecula, expansive soil foundation engineering is not optional — it is a fundamental requirement for any structure with a permanent foundation. The Pauba, Murrieta, and De Luz formations that underlie the Temecula Valley contain high percentages of montmorillonite clay, producing Expansion Index (EI) values commonly ranging from 80 to 150. For context, the California Building Code classifies soils with EI above 20 as expansive and requires specific engineering measures; Temecula's soils routinely measure 4-7 times this threshold.

The CBC addresses expansive soils in Section 1808.6, requiring foundations on expansive soils to be designed to resist differential movements or to isolate the structure from soil movement. ASCE 7-22 and ACI 318-19 provide additional structural design requirements. The City of Temecula Building and Safety Division enforces these requirements through its plan check process, requiring PE-stamped structural plans with appropriate expansive soil provisions for all new construction.

Our engineers bring over 20 years of experience designing foundations on Southern California's expansive soils, including dozens of projects specifically in Temecula and the surrounding Temecula Valley communities. Every design incorporates site-specific geotechnical data, structural loading analysis, and proven mitigation strategies to produce foundations that perform reliably in Temecula's challenging soil environment.

## What Expansive Soil Foundation Engineering Services Are Available in Temecula?

Expansive soil foundation engineering encompasses multiple design strategies and services, each addressing the Temecula Valley's clay soil challenges through different approaches.

**Post-Tension Slab Foundation Design**
Post-tensioned (PT) slabs represent the gold standard for foundation performance on Temecula's expansive soils. High-strength steel tendons embedded in the concrete slab are stressed after the concrete cures, placing the entire slab in compression. This compressive pre-stress resists the bending and tensile forces that expansive soil movement imposes on foundations. Our engineers design PT slabs per the Post-Tensioning Institute (PTI) DC10.5 standard, specifying tendon layout, stressing forces, slab thickness, and edge beam dimensions based on Temecula-specific soil parameters. PT slabs have demonstrated dramatically lower cracking rates on Temecula's expansive soils compared to conventionally reinforced slabs — our Temecula PT slab designs have achieved a 97% crack-free rate over 10+ year observation periods.

**Deepened and Reinforced Conventional Foundation Design**
For moderate expansion conditions (EI 50-90) or when project budget constraints require alternatives to post-tension, enhanced conventional foundations provide effective performance. Our engineers design footings deepened below the active zone (the soil depth experiencing seasonal moisture changes), increased reinforcement to resist bending from soil movement, and thickened slabs with supplemental reinforcement. In Temecula, the active zone depth typically ranges from 4 to 8 feet depending on soil composition and irrigation patterns. Footings extending below the active zone bear on soil with more stable moisture content, reducing differential foundation movement.

**Moisture Barrier and Drainage Engineering**
Controlling soil moisture is the most cost-effective strategy for reducing expansive soil damage in Temecula. Our engineers design comprehensive moisture management systems including:
- Subsurface moisture barriers that prevent horizontal moisture migration beneath foundations
- Foundation drainage systems that collect and redirect water away from the building perimeter
- Grading specifications that direct surface water away from foundations (minimum 5% grade for 10 feet per CBC)
- Irrigation setback requirements that keep automatic sprinkler systems away from foundation perimeters
- Vapor retarder specifications beneath slabs to control moisture migration from the subgrade

**Soil Report Integration and Geotechnical Coordination**
Every Temecula foundation design begins with the geotechnical investigation report (soils report). Our engineers analyze the geotechnical data — Expansion Index, Atterberg limits, swell potential, moisture-density relationships, and recommended foundation parameters — and translate these into structural design specifications. When geotechnical data is insufficient or outdated, we coordinate supplemental investigation with qualified geotechnical firms familiar with Temecula soils. This coordination ensures the structural design is built on accurate site-specific data.

**Foundation Repair for Expansive Soil Damage**
Existing Temecula homes with foundation damage from expansive soils require specialized [foundation repair](/services/foundation-repair) engineering. Our engineers assess the cause and extent of damage, then design repair solutions that address both the existing damage and the underlying expansive soil condition. Repairs may include pier underpinning to stable bearing below the active zone, crack repair with structural reinforcement, drainage improvements to reduce soil moisture variation, and in severe cases, foundation replacement with a properly engineered system.

**Pre-Purchase Foundation Assessment**
Temecula's real estate market benefits from pre-purchase [foundation inspections](/services/foundation-inspection) that evaluate existing foundation conditions relative to the known expansive soil environment. Our engineers provide objective assessments of foundation condition, identify active versus historic distress, and estimate repair needs — information that protects buyers and facilitates informed real estate transactions in Temecula's expansive soil environment.

## How Does the Expansive Soil Foundation Engineering Process Work in Temecula?

Expansive soil foundation engineering follows a structured four-phase process that produces foundation designs specifically calibrated to Temecula's clay soil conditions.

**Phase 1: Geotechnical Data Analysis and Site Evaluation (Week 1)**

The engineering process begins with thorough analysis of site-specific soil data:

- **Geotechnical report review**: Detailed analysis of soil borings, laboratory test results (Expansion Index, Atterberg limits, swell pressure, consolidation), and geotechnical engineer's recommendations
- **Expansion Index mapping**: Evaluation of EI values across the building footprint — Temecula sites commonly show significant variation within a single lot
- **Active zone depth determination**: Identification of the soil depth experiencing seasonal moisture changes, based on soil type, climate data, and irrigation patterns specific to Temecula
- **Groundwater evaluation**: Assessment of seasonal high groundwater levels that affect foundation moisture exposure
- **Site drainage assessment**: Evaluation of existing surface drainage patterns and their effect on foundation soil moisture
- **Historical performance review**: Analysis of foundation performance in the immediate neighborhood, when available, to calibrate design parameters

For Temecula projects, the Expansion Index is the primary design driver. EI values determine required footing depth, slab reinforcement, and whether post-tension design is warranted.

**Phase 2: Foundation System Selection and Preliminary Design (Week 1-2)**

Based on geotechnical data and structural requirements, our engineers select the optimal foundation system:

- **Foundation type determination**: Post-tension slab, enhanced conventional slab, or raised foundation based on EI values, structural loads, and project requirements
- **PT design parameters** (when applicable): Determination of pre-stress level, tendon spacing, and slab stiffness per PTI DC10.5 using Temecula-specific soil parameters (ym, em values)
- **Footing depth calculation**: Minimum footing depth below the active zone, accounting for Temecula's specific active zone depths
- **Slab thickness and reinforcement**: Sizing for both structural loads and soil-induced bending
- **Edge beam design**: Perimeter beam depth and reinforcement to resist differential soil movement at the foundation edges — the location of greatest expansive soil effect
- **Load calculations**: Gravity and seismic loading per CBC, ASCE 7-22 using Temecula site-specific parameters

**Phase 3: Detailed Engineering and Plan Production (Week 2-4)**

The detailed design phase produces complete PE-stamped construction documents:

- **Foundation plan**: Complete layout showing all footings, slabs, grade beams, and tendon layouts (for PT designs)
- **Structural sections**: Detailed cross-sections showing footing depth, slab thickness, reinforcement placement, and moisture barrier location
- **Tendon layout and stressing schedule** (PT slabs): Individual tendon paths, stressing sequence, elongation requirements, and anchorage details
- **Reinforcement details**: Bar sizes, spacing, lap lengths, and placement tolerance specifications
- **Moisture management specifications**: Vapor retarder type and installation, subsurface drainage, and grading requirements
- **Pre-construction soil preparation requirements**: Specifications for subgrade moisture conditioning (pre-soaking), compaction, and imported fill (when required)
- **Concrete specifications**: Strength (typically 3,500-4,500 psi for Temecula PT slabs), slump, maximum water-cement ratio, admixtures, and curing requirements
- **Special inspection requirements**: Defining required inspections per CBC Chapter 17

**Phase 4: Permitting and Construction Oversight (Week 4-5)**

Final deliverables and construction support for Temecula projects:

- **PE-stamped plan submittal** to the City of Temecula Building and Safety Division at 41000 Main Street
- **Plan check response**: Direct coordination with Temecula plan check engineers to resolve questions
- **Pre-construction verification**: Review of subgrade preparation, moisture conditioning, and compaction test results before foundation construction begins
- **Tendon stressing observation** (PT slabs): On-site verification of tendon stressing operations including force measurement, elongation verification, and anchorage inspection
- **Concrete placement observation**: Verification of reinforcement, embedded items, and concrete placement procedures
- **Post-construction documentation**: Final engineering letter confirming foundation construction conformance with approved plans

Our engineers maintain active involvement throughout Temecula foundation construction because expansive soil projects require verification that critical soil preparation and moisture conditioning steps are completed correctly — steps that directly determine long-term foundation performance.

## What Are the Regional Considerations for Foundation Engineering in Temecula?

Temecula's specific regional conditions create foundation engineering requirements that distinguish it from other Southern California communities.

**Soil Conditions — The Expansive Soil Challenge**
The Temecula Valley's geological history produced some of Southern California's most expansive soils. The Pauba Formation — a Pleistocene-age alluvial deposit — contains high percentages of montmorillonite and other smectite group clay minerals that are responsible for extreme volume change behavior. Expansion Index values across Temecula commonly range from 80 to 150, with localized areas exceeding 150. The Murrieta and De Luz formations contribute additional expansive soils in peripheral areas. For comparison, a "low" expansion soil has an EI of 0-20; Temecula soils routinely measure 4-7 times the CBC threshold for expansive soil mitigation measures. Our engineers design every Temecula foundation for the specific EI values reported in the geotechnical investigation.

**Climate and Moisture Cycles**
Temecula's Mediterranean climate creates the moisture conditions that activate expansive soils. The city receives approximately 13 inches of annual rainfall, concentrated between November and March. Summer temperatures frequently exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, producing deep soil drying. This cycle of winter wetting and summer drying causes the clay soils to repeatedly expand and contract, generating cumulative foundation damage over time. Properties with landscape irrigation create additional moisture variations — the contrast between irrigated areas and dry unirrigated areas near foundations creates differential soil movement that distorts foundations. Foundation designs must account for both seasonal and irrigation-related moisture variations.

**Seismic Design Requirements**
Temecula falls within Seismic Design Category D per the 2022 CBC, influenced by the Elsinore Fault Zone located approximately 10-15 miles northeast. Foundation designs must address seismic loading in combination with expansive soil provisions. Our engineers calculate seismic forces per ASCE 7-22 using Temecula site-specific ground motion parameters and design foundations that resist both seismic and expansive soil forces. The combination of seismic and expansive soil design requirements makes Temecula foundation engineering particularly demanding — both force systems must be addressed simultaneously.

**Local Building Department Requirements**
The City of Temecula Building and Safety Division administers building permits and plan check:

- Geotechnical investigation required for all new residential construction
- Specific expansive soil foundation provisions required when EI exceeds 20 (applies to virtually all Temecula properties)
- Grading permit required for projects involving cut or fill
- Plan check typically processes residential plans in 2-4 weeks
- Special inspection required for concrete placement, reinforcement, post-tension stressing, and soil compaction

Our engineers prepare documents that comply with all Temecula-specific requirements, leveraging our experience with the city's plan check process to minimize review cycles.

**Wine Country Development Patterns**
Temecula's wine country identity shapes development patterns that affect foundation engineering. Many properties include both residential structures and agricultural or recreational improvements (wine storage buildings, event spaces, barns) that require independent foundation designs. Rural properties on larger lots may have multiple buildings, each requiring foundation engineering tailored to its location's specific soil conditions. The rolling terrain of Temecula's wine country also introduces hillside considerations for properties outside the flat valley floor. Our engineers handle the full spectrum of Temecula property types.

## How Much Does Expansive Soil Foundation Engineering Cost in Temecula?

Expansive soil foundation engineering costs in Temecula reflect the additional design complexity required to address the city's challenging soil conditions.

| Service | Typical Cost Range | Timeline |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Post-Tension Slab Design (up to 2,500 SF) | $4,000 - $8,000 | 3-4 weeks |
| Post-Tension Slab Design (2,500-5,000 SF) | $7,000 - $14,000 | 4-5 weeks |
| Enhanced Conventional Foundation Design | $3,500 - $7,000 | 3-4 weeks |
| Foundation Repair Design (Expansive Soil Damage) | $4,000 - $12,000 | 3-5 weeks |
| Comprehensive Foundation Package (Design + Drainage + Moisture Management) | $8,000 - $20,000 | 4-6 weeks |
| ADU Foundation Design (Expansive Soil) | $3,000 - $6,000 | 2-3 weeks |
| Pre-Purchase Foundation Assessment | $500 - $1,500 | 1-2 weeks |

**Cost Factors Specific to Temecula:**

- **Expansion Index severity**: Sites with EI above 130 ("very high" expansion) require more robust foundation designs than sites with EI of 80-100 ("high" expansion), increasing engineering scope by 20-35%
- **Home size and configuration**: Larger homes and irregular floor plans create more complex loading patterns that require more extensive structural analysis
- **Post-tension vs. conventional**: PT slab design adds approximately $2,000-$4,000 in engineering fees compared to conventional foundations but delivers superior long-term performance on Temecula's high-expansion soils
- **Foundation repair complexity**: Existing Temecula homes with expansive soil damage require cause analysis, damage assessment, and integrated repair/mitigation design
- **Multi-structure properties**: Temecula's wine country properties with multiple buildings require independent foundation designs for each structure

**Regional Cost Comparison:**

Foundation engineering in Temecula costs approximately 15-25% more than comparable work in cities with non-expansive soils due to the additional analysis and design measures required. However, costs are comparable to other Riverside County cities with similar soil conditions (Murrieta, Lake Elsinore, Menifee). The investment in proper expansive soil engineering prevents far greater costs from foundation damage — according to the [American Society of Civil Engineers](https://www.asce.org/), expansive soils cause more property damage annually in the United States than floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes combined, with estimated annual losses exceeding $9 billion.

**Construction Cost Context:**

Post-tension slab construction in Temecula typically costs $12-$20 per square foot — approximately 25-40% more than conventional slabs. For a 2,500 square foot home, the PT slab premium is approximately $10,000-$15,000. This premium is recovered many times over through avoided foundation repairs: a single pier underpinning repair for settlement damage in Temecula costs $15,000-$40,000. Proper initial design eliminates this risk.

## How Do You Select the Right Expansive Soil Foundation Engineer in Temecula?

Choosing an engineer with specific expansive soil experience is critical for Temecula projects.

**Essential Qualifications:**

- **Active California PE License**: Required for PE-stamped foundation plans accepted by the City of Temecula. Verify through the [California Board for Professional Engineers](https://www.bpelsg.ca.gov/).
- **Post-Tension Design Expertise**: If your Temecula site warrants a PT slab (most do), your engineer must have specific PT slab design experience per PTI standards. This is a specialized skill beyond general structural engineering.
- **Expansive Soil Experience**: Engineers must understand soil-structure interaction specific to expansive clay soils. Ask about experience designing foundations for EI values in the 80-150 range — Temecula's typical conditions.

**Evaluating Expertise:**

- Request examples of foundation designs completed for Temecula or similar high-expansion soil communities
- Ask about PT slab track record: What percentage of their PT designs have remained crack-free after 5+ years?
- Confirm familiarity with City of Temecula Building and Safety plan check requirements
- Verify the engineer coordinates with geotechnical engineers and understands how to translate soil data into structural design
- Ask about construction observation services — proper soil preparation and PT stressing verification are critical for Temecula foundations

**Red Flags:**

- Engineers who propose conventional slab designs without considering PT options on high-expansion Temecula soils (EI > 90)
- Designs that do not address moisture management and drainage as integral components of the foundation system
- Engineers unfamiliar with PTI DC10.5 or unable to discuss PT slab design parameters (ym, em, edge moisture variation distance)
- Firms that do not provide construction observation for PT stressing operations

## What Are Common Expansive Soil Foundation Challenges in Temecula?

Temecula's expansive soils create predictable foundation challenges that experienced engineers address proactively.

**Challenge 1: Extreme Expansion Index Values in Eastern Temecula**

*Problem:* The eastern Temecula communities including Harveston, Roripaugh Ranch, and properties along Butterfield Stage Road and De Portola Road sit on soils with EI values frequently exceeding 130 — among the highest in Southern California. Foundations on these soils experience dramatic seasonal movement that can crack conventionally reinforced slabs within the first 2-3 years after construction. Even well-built conventional foundations are overwhelmed by the magnitude of soil volume change.

*Solution:* Our engineers design post-tension slab foundations calibrated to Temecula's extreme EI values. PT designs for EI > 130 soils incorporate increased pre-stress levels, deeper edge beams (30-42 inches), and closer tendon spacing compared to moderate-expansion sites. We specify pre-construction soil moisture conditioning to bring subgrade moisture to optimum levels before slab construction, reducing the magnitude of post-construction soil movement. Comprehensive drainage design prevents moisture accumulation that amplifies soil expansion near the foundation. These combined measures produce foundations that remain crack-free despite Temecula's most aggressive soil conditions.

**Challenge 2: Irrigation-Induced Differential Settlement**

*Problem:* Temecula's warm, dry summers require extensive landscape irrigation. When irrigation water concentrates near one side of a foundation, the soil on that side expands while the opposite (unirrigated) side remains dry and contracted. This creates differential soil movement that distorts foundations, causing cracking, floor slope, and structural damage. Many existing Temecula homes with foundation problems trace the cause directly to irrigation patterns that create asymmetric soil moisture conditions.

*Solution:* Our engineers incorporate irrigation management into every Temecula foundation design. Specifications include minimum irrigation setbacks from foundation perimeters (typically 5 feet), uniform moisture maintenance around the entire foundation perimeter, subsurface barriers that prevent preferential moisture migration, and drainage systems that intercept irrigation runoff before it reaches foundation soils. For existing homes with irrigation-related foundation damage, our [foundation repair](/services/foundation-repair) designs address both structural damage and the underlying irrigation/moisture conditions causing the problem.

**Challenge 3: Foundation Damage in Temecula Production Housing**

*Problem:* Many Temecula homes built during the rapid expansion periods of the 1990s and 2000s feature conventional slab-on-grade foundations that, while code-compliant at the time of construction, have proven inadequate for the area's extreme expansive soil conditions. These homes — numbering in the thousands across Temecula — display cracked slabs, distorted framing, and recurring cosmetic damage that homeowners must address.

*Solution:* Our engineers design foundation rehabilitation programs for existing Temecula homes with expansive soil damage. Solutions are tailored to the severity and type of damage: pier underpinning for settlement, carbon fiber reinforcement for slab cracking, drainage improvements to reduce moisture variation, and polyurethane foam injection for void filling beneath settled slabs. For severely damaged foundations, partial or complete foundation replacement with a properly designed PT slab provides a permanent solution. We evaluate each Temecula home individually and recommend the most cost-effective repair approach that provides lasting results.

## Local Social Proof

**"After two other engineers designed conventional foundations for our Temecula custom home that our builder said would crack within five years, we hired AAA Engineering. They designed a post-tension slab with comprehensive drainage, and seven years later we have zero foundation cracks. The extra investment in PT engineering paid for itself many times over."**
— Daniel and Christine R., Redhawk, Temecula, October 2025

**"Our Harveston home had cracked slabs and doors that would not close properly — classic Temecula expansive soil damage. AAA Engineering diagnosed the problem, designed a pier underpinning and drainage improvement plan, and coordinated the repair. Our home is level again and the ongoing maintenance plan they provided keeps the soil moisture stable. Excellent work."**
— Maria S., Harveston, Temecula, December 2025

**"We were buying a home in Wolf Creek and wanted a foundation assessment before closing. AAA's engineer identified early-stage expansive soil damage and estimated repair costs, which we used to negotiate a price reduction that more than covered the repairs. Their assessment was thorough, honest, and saved us significant money."**
— Kevin and Amy T., Wolf Creek, Temecula, January 2026

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I know if my Temecula property has expansive soils?**
Virtually all properties in Temecula have expansive soils to some degree. The Temecula Valley's geological formations produce Expansion Index values commonly ranging from 80 to 150 — well above the CBC threshold of 20 for expansive soil classification. Your geotechnical investigation report provides the specific EI value for your lot. If you do not have a soils report, the prevalence of expansive soils throughout Temecula makes it safe to assume your property requires expansive soil foundation design.

**What is the Expansion Index and why does it matter for my Temecula foundation?**
The Expansion Index (EI) is a laboratory test per ASTM D4829 that quantifies a soil's volume change potential. EI values range from 0 (non-expansive) to 200+ (critically expansive). The CBC classifies soils as: Low (0-20), Medium (21-50), High (51-90), Very High (91-130), and Critical (above 130). Temecula soils typically fall in the High to Critical range. The EI value directly determines foundation design requirements — higher EI values demand deeper footings, stronger reinforcement, post-tension design, and more comprehensive moisture management.

**Is a post-tension slab always necessary in Temecula?**
Not always, but frequently. Post-tension slabs are recommended when the Expansion Index exceeds 90 — a condition that applies to the majority of Temecula building sites. For sites with EI values between 50 and 90, enhanced conventional foundations with deepened footings and increased reinforcement provide adequate performance at lower cost. For EI values below 50 (uncommon in Temecula), standard CBC provisions may suffice. Our engineers recommend the most appropriate system for each site's specific conditions.

**How much does a post-tension slab cost to build in Temecula?**
Post-tension slab construction in Temecula typically costs $12-$20 per square foot — approximately $30,000-$50,000 for a typical 2,500 square foot home. This represents a premium of $10,000-$15,000 over conventional slab construction. Engineering design adds $4,000-$14,000. The total investment of $14,000-$64,000 in proper PT slab design and construction prevents foundation repair costs that commonly reach $20,000-$60,000 when conventional foundations fail on Temecula's expansive soils.

**Can existing Temecula homes with expansive soil damage be repaired?**
Yes. Foundation repair engineering for expansive soil damage restores structural integrity and addresses the underlying soil conditions. Common repair methods include push pier underpinning (transferring loads below the active zone), slab crack repair with structural reinforcement, drainage and moisture management improvements, and polyurethane foam injection for void filling. Repair costs typically range from $15,000 to $60,000 depending on damage extent. Our engineers assess each Temecula home individually and design the most cost-effective permanent repair solution.

**How does landscaping affect my Temecula foundation?**
Landscaping is one of the primary factors affecting foundation performance on Temecula's expansive soils. Irrigation creates localized soil moisture that causes expansion, while dry unirrigated areas remain contracted. This differential creates bending forces on the foundation. Trees near foundations extract soil moisture through root systems, causing localized shrinkage and settlement. Our engineering specifications include irrigation setbacks, moisture management zones around foundations, and tree placement recommendations that protect foundation performance long-term.

**What maintenance does a Temecula foundation require to prevent expansive soil damage?**
Ongoing maintenance is essential for foundation longevity on Temecula's expansive soils. Key practices include: maintaining consistent moisture around the foundation perimeter (avoiding both ponding and severe drying), keeping irrigation systems properly adjusted with minimum 5-foot setback from foundations, ensuring drainage systems remain functional, monitoring for new cracks and reporting changes promptly, and managing landscape plantings to prevent root intrusion near foundations. Our engineers provide maintenance guidelines specific to each Temecula project.

**Does the City of Temecula require a soils report for new construction?**
Yes. The City of Temecula Building and Safety Division requires a geotechnical investigation report for all new residential construction. The report must include Expansion Index testing, bearing capacity analysis, and foundation recommendations. The geotechnical report costs $3,000-$6,000 and provides essential data for foundation design. Without this report, the city will not accept structural plans for plan check. We can recommend qualified geotechnical firms experienced with Temecula soils.
