## What Is Earthquake Damage Structural Engineering?

Earthquake damage structural engineering is the specialized practice of evaluating buildings after seismic events to determine structural safety, quantify damage, identify compromised structural systems, and design repairs that restore or improve the building's seismic performance. This discipline requires deep knowledge of seismic loading, structural dynamics, concrete and steel behavior under cyclic loading, wood-frame lateral force resistance, and the interaction between buildings and the ground motion they experience.

In Glendale, earthquake damage engineering carries heightened importance because of the city's seismic exposure. Glendale sits between the Verdugo Fault (running directly beneath the Verdugo Mountains along the city's northern boundary), the Raymond Fault to the south, and the Sierra Madre Fault system to the north. The 2014 La Habra earthquake, the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence, and ongoing microseismic activity along these faults demonstrate that Glendale's seismic risk is active and ongoing.

**You need an earthquake damage engineer when:**

- You feel a significant earthquake and observe any damage to your Glendale property
- New cracks appear in walls, foundation, or chimney after seismic activity
- Doors or windows no longer open or close properly after an earthquake
- You hear or observe structural shifting, popping, or cracking during or after an earthquake
- Your building has been red-tagged or yellow-tagged by city inspectors
- Your insurance company requires engineering documentation for an earthquake damage claim
- You want a professional assessment even when damage is not immediately visible
- A neighboring property has sustained earthquake damage and you want proactive evaluation

## What Earthquake Damage Services Are Available in Glendale?

AAA Engineering Design provides the complete range of earthquake damage structural engineering services for Glendale's diverse building stock, from single-family hillside homes to multi-story commercial buildings and apartment complexes.

### ATC-20 Rapid Safety Evaluation

The ATC-20 (Applied Technology Council) post-earthquake safety evaluation is the standard protocol used throughout California for determining whether earthquake-damaged buildings are safe to occupy. Our engineers perform ATC-20 evaluations that classify buildings as:

- **Green (Inspected)**: No apparent structural hazard found. Lawful occupancy permitted.
- **Yellow (Restricted Use)**: Damaged building. Entry and occupancy restricted as noted. Specific areas may be off-limits.
- **Red (Unsafe)**: Extreme hazard. Do not enter or occupy. Entry by owner permitted only with professional escort for personal property retrieval.

This ATC-20 classification directly affects your ability to occupy your Glendale property, your insurance claim processing, and the urgency of repair engineering.

### Detailed Structural Damage Assessment

Beyond the rapid safety evaluation, our detailed assessment systematically evaluates every structural system in your Glendale building:

- **Foundation systems**: Evaluation of foundation cracking, settlement, lateral displacement, and bearing capacity
- **Vertical load-carrying systems**: Assessment of columns, posts, bearing walls, and their connections for damage
- **Lateral force-resisting systems**: Evaluation of shear walls, braced frames, moment frames, and diaphragms that resist earthquake forces
- **Connections**: Inspection of critical connections between structural elements where earthquake forces concentrate
- **Non-structural elements**: Assessment of chimneys, parapets, cladding, and other elements that pose falling hazards

### FEMA Damage Assessment Documentation

When a presidential disaster declaration covers Glendale (as has occurred following past California earthquakes), FEMA Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs provide financial support for earthquake recovery. Our engineering documentation meets FEMA requirements for damage verification, supporting your application for federal assistance. We document the Verified Loss amount that FEMA uses to determine assistance levels.

### Earthquake Repair Engineering

After assessment, our engineers design structural repairs that restore your Glendale building's safety and, where appropriate, improve its seismic performance beyond pre-earthquake conditions. Repair engineering includes:

- Structural member repair and replacement design
- Foundation repair and reinforcement design
- Shear wall repair and enhancement design
- Connection upgrade design
- [Seismic retrofitting](/services/seismic-retrofitting) design for buildings that were code-deficient before the earthquake

### Insurance Claim Engineering Support

Earthquake insurance claims require engineering documentation that quantifies damage, establishes causation, and estimates repair costs. Our PE-stamped reports provide the technical evidence that insurance adjusters need to process claims. We distinguish earthquake damage from pre-existing conditions, settlement, and other non-seismic causes, which is critical because earthquake insurance policies typically have high deductibles (10-20% of insured value in California) and insurers scrutinize claims carefully.

### Soft-Story and Vulnerable Building Assessment

Glendale has a significant inventory of soft-story buildings, particularly apartment buildings constructed in the 1950s through 1970s with open ground-floor parking. These buildings are the most vulnerable to earthquake damage due to their weak lower stories. Following an earthquake, soft-story buildings require specialized assessment that evaluates the ground-floor lateral system's performance. Glendale's mandatory soft-story retrofit ordinance has addressed many of these buildings, but not all have been retrofitted.

## How Does Earthquake Damage Assessment Work in Glendale?

Our earthquake damage assessment process follows a structured methodology that produces reliable, defensible results for safety determination, insurance claims, and repair engineering.

### Step 1: Post-Earthquake Contact

Call **(949) 981-4448** after an earthquake affects your Glendale property. Our earthquake response team activates following any significant seismic event in the Los Angeles area. We prioritize calls based on reported damage severity and building type vulnerability.

### Step 2: Rapid Response Deployment

Our licensed PE deploys to your Glendale property. Response times depend on earthquake scope: isolated events affecting individual buildings receive response within hours; widespread earthquakes affecting large areas of Glendale require triage-based prioritization. We access Glendale properties via the 134 Freeway, I-5, the 2 Freeway, and surface streets including Brand Boulevard, Glendale Avenue, and Verdugo Road.

### Step 3: Exterior Rapid Assessment

The engineer begins with a systematic exterior walk-around assessing:

- Overall building lean or displacement
- Foundation displacement or settlement
- Exterior wall cracks (distinguishing structural from cosmetic)
- Chimney damage (one of the most common earthquake damage indicators in Glendale)
- Parapet and cladding damage
- Site distress (ground cracking, lateral spreading, liquefaction indicators)
- Utility connections and potential gas leaks

### Step 4: Interior Detailed Assessment

If exterior assessment indicates the building is safe to enter, the engineer conducts systematic interior assessment:

- Wall crack documentation with measurement and pattern analysis
- Floor level survey to detect foundation displacement
- Door and window operation testing (frame racking indicators)
- Attic inspection for roof diaphragm and shear wall top plate connections
- Crawl space or basement inspection for foundation and cripple wall assessment
- Exposed structural element evaluation where accessible

### Step 5: Structural System Classification

Based on findings, the engineer classifies the damage by structural system:

- **Lateral system damage**: Shear wall cracking, brace buckling, moment frame distortion
- **Gravity system damage**: Column cracking, bearing wall damage, floor or roof framing damage
- **Foundation damage**: Settlement, cracking, lateral displacement
- **Connection damage**: Failed fasteners, separated framing members, broken welds
- **Non-structural damage**: Chimney, parapet, cladding, ceiling failures

### Step 6: Safety Determination and Tagging Recommendation

The engineer provides an ATC-20-based safety determination (green, yellow, or red) with specific occupancy restrictions if applicable. This determination is communicated immediately on-site.

### Step 7: Comprehensive Written Report (3-7 Business Days)

The PE-stamped report documents:

- Building description and structural system identification
- Earthquake event information (magnitude, distance, estimated ground motion)
- Detailed damage documentation with annotated photographs
- Structural analysis of damage significance
- ATC-20 classification and occupancy determination
- Repair recommendations with scope and cost estimates
- Seismic vulnerability assessment and retrofit recommendations
- FEMA documentation if applicable

### Step 8: Repair Design and Permitting

When repairs are needed, our team transitions to repair engineering. We design structural repairs compliant with the California Building Code and City of Glendale requirements, prepare permit-ready construction documents, and support your project through the City of Glendale building department review process.

## What Are the Glendale-Specific Seismic Considerations?

Glendale's seismic environment, building inventory, and geological conditions create specific considerations for earthquake damage assessment.

### The Verdugo Fault

The Verdugo Fault runs along the base of the Verdugo Mountains, directly along Glendale's northern boundary. This thrust fault is capable of producing earthquakes up to magnitude 6.7, according to the USGS Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast. A rupture on the Verdugo Fault would produce the strongest ground shaking Glendale has experienced in modern times. Properties in the foothills neighborhoods of north Glendale, including Montrose, La Crescenta-adjacent areas, and the Verdugo Woodlands, sit closest to this fault and would experience the most intense shaking.

### The Raymond Fault

The Raymond Fault crosses southern Glendale, running roughly east-west through the area south of the 134 Freeway. This left-lateral strike-slip fault is capable of magnitude 6.5+ earthquakes and connects to the broader Hollywood Fault system. Properties in the Tropico, Adams Hill, and Grandview neighborhoods sit within the Raymond Fault's influence zone.

### Glendale's Building Inventory by Era

Glendale's building stock spans over a century of construction, with each era carrying different seismic vulnerability:

- **Pre-1933 (before the Long Beach earthquake)**: Unreinforced masonry buildings, many in downtown Glendale and the Brand Boulevard commercial corridor. These are the most seismically vulnerable buildings in the city. Glendale's URM retrofit ordinance has addressed many, but some remain.
- **1933-1971 (pre-San Fernando earthquake)**: Improved but still vulnerable construction. Soft-story apartment buildings from this era are common throughout Glendale, particularly along major boulevards.
- **1971-1994 (pre-Northridge earthquake)**: Significantly better seismic design, but still lacking the connection details and redundancy that post-Northridge codes require. Many Glendale homes and commercial buildings fall in this category.
- **Post-1994**: Modern seismic design incorporating lessons from the Northridge earthquake. These buildings generally perform well in moderate earthquakes.

Understanding which era your Glendale building belongs to directly informs the assessment approach and expected damage patterns.

### Hillside and Foothill Properties

Glendale extends from the flat Glendale Narrows area up into the Verdugo Mountains and San Rafael Hills. Hillside properties experience different earthquake effects than flat-lot properties:

- **Topographic amplification**: Shaking intensity increases at hilltops and ridgelines, exposing hillside homes to stronger ground motion than flat-area homes at the same distance from the fault
- **Slope instability**: Earthquakes trigger landslides and rockfalls on steep slopes, threatening hillside homes and roads
- **Retaining wall vulnerability**: The thousands of retaining walls supporting Glendale's hillside development are stressed by earthquake forces that they may not have been designed to resist

### Soft-Story Apartment Buildings

Glendale has a large inventory of multi-story apartment buildings with open ground-floor parking, a construction type known to be highly vulnerable to earthquake damage. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused 16 deaths in soft-story building collapses across Los Angeles. Glendale's soft-story retrofit program has strengthened many of these buildings, but earthquake damage assessment for soft-story buildings requires specialized evaluation of the ground-floor lateral system's performance and any post-retrofit modifications.

### Liquefaction Potential

Areas of Glendale along the Los Angeles River and Verdugo Wash have liquefaction potential, where groundwater-saturated loose sandy soils can lose bearing capacity during earthquake shaking. Properties in the Glendale Narrows, along the 134 Freeway corridor, and in portions of the Grandview and Pacific Edison neighborhoods should be evaluated for liquefaction effects after significant earthquakes.

## How Much Does Earthquake Damage Engineering Cost in Glendale?

Earthquake damage engineering costs in Glendale vary based on building size, damage extent, and the services required.

| Soft-story retrofit design | $6,000 - $12,000 | 4-8 weeks |
| Construction support and inspection | $1,500 - $5,000 | Duration of construction |

### Factors Affecting Cost in Glendale

**Building size**: A 1,500-square-foot single-family home requires significantly less assessment time than a 20-unit apartment building or a 10,000-square-foot commercial building.

**Damage extent**: Light damage assessment (a few cracks, minor displacement) requires less documentation and analysis than heavy damage with multiple structural system involvement.

**Building type and era**: Pre-1933 unreinforced masonry buildings require more detailed assessment than modern wood-frame construction. Soft-story buildings require specialized lateral system evaluation.

**Report scope**: A basic safety determination costs less than a comprehensive report with repair cost estimates, insurance documentation, and FEMA assistance applications.

**Number of buildings**: Multi-building properties (apartment complexes, commercial centers) require proportionally more assessment time per building.

### Insurance and FEMA Reimbursement

Earthquake insurance policies cover engineering assessment costs when damage results from a seismic event. California Earthquake Authority (CEA) policies and private earthquake policies both accept PE-stamped engineering reports for claim processing. FEMA Individual Assistance may also reimburse engineering assessment costs when a presidential disaster declaration covers the Glendale area. Our reports are formatted to support both insurance and FEMA reimbursement.

## How Do You Find a Reliable Earthquake Damage Engineer Near Glendale?

Post-earthquake, the demand for structural engineering services surges while supply remains constant. Knowing how to identify and secure qualified earthquake damage engineering service in Glendale is essential for timely recovery.

### Essential Qualifications for Earthquake Damage Assessment

**California PE License with seismic experience**: Post-earthquake structural assessment requires specialized seismic engineering knowledge beyond general structural practice. Look for engineers with specific experience in earthquake damage assessment, seismic retrofitting, and ATC-20 evaluation protocols.

**ATC-20 training**: The Applied Technology Council's post-earthquake safety evaluation procedures are the standard in California. Engineers performing ATC-20 evaluations should have completed ATC-20 training and have experience applying the protocols.

**Local building knowledge**: Glendale's diverse building stock requires engineers who understand the seismic behavior of different construction types found in the city: unreinforced masonry, soft-story wood-frame, tilt-up concrete, steel moment frame, and modern wood-frame with engineered shear walls.

**Insurance documentation experience**: Post-earthquake insurance claims require specific documentation. Engineers experienced with earthquake insurance claims produce reports that meet insurer requirements, reducing claim processing delays.

### Red Flags

- Engineers who offer earthquake damage assessment without PE licensure
- Firms that combine assessment with contracting (conflict of interest)
- Engineers unfamiliar with ATC-20 protocols or unable to explain the tagging process
- Firms that provide generic reports not specific to your building's structural system
- Engineers who recommend extensive repairs without documenting pre-earthquake conditions (this distinction is critical for insurance claims)

### Pre-Earthquake Preparation

The best time to establish a relationship with an earthquake damage engineer is before an earthquake occurs. Glendale property owners who identify their engineering resource in advance receive priority response when an earthquake strikes. Contact AAA Engineering Design now at (949) 981-4448 to register your Glendale property for priority post-earthquake response.

## What Are Common Earthquake Damage Issues in Glendale?

Glendale's seismic environment and building inventory produce characteristic earthquake damage patterns. Understanding these common scenarios helps property owners recognize damage and respond appropriately.

### Scenario 1: Soft-Story Apartment Building Lateral Displacement

**The situation**: A 1960s two-story apartment building on Glendale's Central Avenue experiences a moderate earthquake. The ground floor, which has open parking with minimal walls, visibly shifts relative to the second floor. The building develops a noticeable lean, and residents on both floors report doors that will not close and windows that have cracked.

**The response**: Our ATC-20 rapid evaluation classifies the building as Yellow (Restricted Use), with ground-floor parking prohibited and upper-floor occupancy limited to daytime access for personal property retrieval. Detailed assessment reveals that the ground-floor lateral system, consisting of only two short plywood shear walls between parking openings, has failed. The plywood has separated from the framing at nailing lines, and the building has permanently displaced 3 inches laterally.

**The outcome**: We design an emergency shoring system to stabilize the building and prevent additional displacement during aftershocks. The permanent repair design includes a complete soft-story retrofit with steel moment frames at the ground floor, meeting current code requirements for seismic force resistance. The building's seismic performance after repair significantly exceeds its pre-earthquake condition.

### Scenario 2: Hillside Home Foundation and Retaining Wall Damage

**The situation**: A single-family home in the Verdugo Woodlands experiences an earthquake centered on the nearby Verdugo Fault. The homeowner discovers cracks in the foundation stem walls, separation between the house and the hillside retaining wall, and a new crack across the driveway.

**The response**: Our assessment determines that the foundation has experienced differential settlement of approximately 1 inch due to the earthquake's vertical acceleration component. The retaining wall has rotated forward under seismic earth pressure, separating from the house structure. The driveway crack indicates ground displacement along the slope. We classify the home as Yellow with restrictions on the rooms adjacent to the retaining wall.

**The outcome**: Our repair design addresses three systems: foundation releveling through localized underpinning, retaining wall replacement with a seismically designed tied-back wall, and improved hillside drainage to reduce post-earthquake landslide risk. The repair design incorporates [hillside engineering](/services/hillside-engineering) principles that address both the earthquake damage and the site's ongoing geotechnical challenges. The engineering documentation supports the homeowner's earthquake insurance claim for approximately $180,000 in covered repairs.

### Scenario 3: Unreinforced Masonry Commercial Building Damage

**The situation**: A 1920s commercial building on Brand Boulevard sustains earthquake damage including parapet cracking, wall separation at corners, and diagonal cracking in the masonry walls. The building houses a restaurant on the ground floor and offices on the second floor.

**The response**: Our assessment reveals that the unreinforced masonry walls have developed diagonal shear cracks at multiple locations, consistent with in-plane seismic forces. The parapet has developed a horizontal crack at the roof line, creating a falling hazard. Corner separations indicate that the masonry walls are no longer connected to each other, compromising the building's box-like resistance to lateral forces. We classify the building as Red (Unsafe) due to the parapet falling hazard and compromised lateral system.

**The outcome**: We design an emergency parapet bracing system to remove the immediate falling hazard, allowing the building to be reclassified to Yellow for limited access. The permanent repair design includes comprehensive seismic retrofit: steel frames added within the masonry structure, wall anchoring to floor and roof diaphragms, and parapet bracing. The retrofit brings the building into compliance with Glendale's unreinforced masonry building standards, protecting both occupants and pedestrians on Brand Boulevard.

### Scenario 4: Chimney Collapse and Roof Damage in Adams Hill

**The situation**: An earthquake damages a 1950s single-family home in the Adams Hill neighborhood. The brick chimney collapses through the roof, leaving debris on the living room floor and an opening in the roof structure.

**The response**: Our emergency assessment documents the chimney collapse mechanism: the unreinforced brick chimney, common in Glendale homes of this era, separated at the roof line and fell inward when the earthquake's lateral acceleration exceeded the chimney's bending capacity. The collapsed chimney has damaged two roof rafters and the ceiling joists below. We classify the home as Yellow with the chimney/living room area restricted.

**The outcome**: We design removal of the remaining chimney stub (which is unstable) and repair of the damaged roof structure using engineered lumber connections. The chimney is not reconstructed in masonry; instead, we specify a modern, seismically compliant steel-braced flue system. The repair design also includes a [structural inspection](/services/structural-inspection) of the remaining building to identify other seismically vulnerable elements. The total repair cost is approximately $25,000, fully covered by the homeowner's earthquake insurance after the 10% deductible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can you assess earthquake damage at my Glendale property?

AAA Engineering Design provides rapid post-earthquake response to Glendale properties. For isolated incidents, response is typically within hours. Following a major earthquake affecting large areas, we triage based on damage severity and building vulnerability. Registered properties receive priority scheduling. Call (949) 981-4448 immediately after any earthquake that produces damage.

### How much does a post-earthquake structural assessment cost in Glendale?

ATC-20 rapid safety evaluations range from $1,000 to $2,500. Detailed structural damage assessments with PE-stamped reports range from $2,500 to $6,000 depending on building size and damage extent. Insurance claim documentation packages range from $3,000 to $7,000. These costs are typically reimbursable through earthquake insurance.

### What is ATC-20 tagging, and what do the colors mean?

ATC-20 is the California standard for post-earthquake building safety evaluation. Green means inspected and safe for occupancy. Yellow means restricted use with specific limitations. Red means unsafe and entry is prohibited except for personal property retrieval with professional escort. Our licensed PEs perform ATC-20 evaluations and provide the documentation that supports the classification.

### Will my earthquake insurance cover the engineering assessment?

Yes. Both California Earthquake Authority (CEA) policies and private earthquake insurance policies cover engineering assessment costs when damage results from a covered seismic event. Our reports are formatted to support insurance claim processing. Be aware that CEA policies have 5-25% deductibles based on your coverage selection.

### What should I do immediately after an earthquake at my Glendale property?

Check for gas leaks (smell, hissing) and shut off gas at the meter if detected. Evacuate if you observe structural damage: leaning walls, sagging ceilings, or severe cracking. Do not use elevators. Document visible damage with photographs from a safe distance. Call (949) 981-4448 for structural engineering assessment. Do not attempt to repair or shore structural elements without engineering guidance.

### Can earthquake damage be hidden behind walls?

Yes. This is one of the most important reasons for professional post-earthquake assessment in Glendale. Shear wall damage (cracked plywood, failed nailing, separated framing) is concealed behind drywall and stucco. Foundation cracks may be below grade. Roof diaphragm connection failures occur in the attic space. Professional assessment includes evaluation of these concealed systems through indicator assessment and, when necessary, selective opening of finishes.

### Does my Glendale building need seismic retrofitting after earthquake damage?

If earthquake damage reveals that your Glendale building's seismic performance was inadequate, our assessment report will recommend seismic retrofitting as part of the repair scope. Common retrofits for Glendale buildings include soft-story strengthening, cripple wall bracing, foundation bolting, and chimney bracing or removal. Retrofit during earthquake repair is cost-effective because the building is already opened for repair work.

### How do I apply for FEMA assistance for earthquake damage in Glendale?

FEMA assistance is available when a presidential disaster declaration covers the Glendale area. Applications are submitted through DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-3362. Our engineering documentation supports FEMA applications by providing professional damage verification, repair cost estimates, and the technical information that FEMA reviewers need to process your claim. We assist Glendale property owners with the documentation requirements throughout the FEMA application process.
