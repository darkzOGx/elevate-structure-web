## What Commercial Projects Require Structural Engineering in Irvine?

Irvine's diverse commercial environment includes multiple project types requiring structural engineering services. Understanding when engineering is required helps project stakeholders plan appropriately.

**Tenant Improvement Projects**
Commercial tenant improvements frequently require structural engineering when modifications affect building structure. Wall removals, mezzanine installations, heavy equipment support, and storefront changes commonly require PE-stamped plans for Irvine permits.

**New Commercial Construction**
Ground-up commercial development requires comprehensive structural engineering from concept through construction completion. Office buildings, retail centers, industrial facilities, and mixed-use projects all need qualified structural engineers.

**Building Renovations**
Existing building modifications—adding floors, removing structural elements, changing occupancy types, or upgrading for new tenants—require structural evaluation and engineering.

**Seismic Evaluations and Retrofits**
Commercial buildings may require seismic assessment for due diligence, insurance purposes, or regulatory compliance. Retrofit engineering designs improvements when existing buildings need seismic strengthening.

**Equipment and Loading Changes**
Installing heavy equipment, high-density filing systems, or changing building use may require structural verification that existing construction can support new loads.
