Understanding what structural engineers do is essential for property owners planning construction projects in Alhambra, San Gabriel, Monterey Park, and the San Gabriel Valley. Structural engineers play a critical role in ensuring buildings are safe, code-compliant, and able to withstand the forces they'll encounter throughout their lifetime.

As Alhambra continues to evolve with new residential developments, commercial projects along Valley Boulevard and Main Street, and historic building renovations, knowing what structural engineers do helps you determine when their expertise is needed and what value they bring to your project.

## What is a Structural Engineer?

A structural engineer is a licensed professional who specializes in designing and analyzing the load-bearing elements of buildings and structures. In Alhambra and throughout California, structural engineers must hold a Professional Engineer (PE) license with either a Civil or Structural discipline designation.

Structural engineers apply principles of physics, mathematics, and material science to ensure buildings can safely support their own weight, occupants, contents, and resist external forces like wind, earthquakes, and snow. Our [structural engineering services](/services/structural-engineering) provide comprehensive solutions for residential, commercial, and industrial projects.

## Core Responsibilities of Structural Engineers

### Structural Analysis & Design

**Load Calculations**
Structural engineers calculate all forces acting on buildings:

**Gravity Loads:**
- Dead loads (permanent weight of building materials)
- Live loads (occupants, furniture, equipment)
- Snow loads (minimal in Alhambra but required by code)
- Roof live loads

**Lateral Loads:**
- Seismic forces (critical in Alhambra's Seismic Zone 4)
- Wind forces
- Soil pressure on foundations and retaining walls

**Special Loads:**
- Equipment loads (HVAC, solar panels, etc.)
- Impact loads
- Vibration loads
- Thermal forces

**Structural System Design**
Engineers select and design appropriate structural systems:

**Foundation Systems:**
- Shallow foundations (spread footings, continuous footings)
- Deep foundations (piles, caissons)
- Mat foundations
- Post-tensioned slabs
- Retaining walls

**Framing Systems:**
- Wood frame (most Alhambra residential)
- Steel frame (commercial, industrial)
- Concrete frame (multi-story, parking structures)
- Masonry (reinforced CMU)
