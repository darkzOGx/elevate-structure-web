- Tie-in of new framing to existing structure
- Load path continuity from roof to foundation
- Coordination of lateral force resistance
- Weather barrier continuity

**Existing Structure Assessment**

Engineers evaluate existing conditions:
- Existing foundation capacity for additional loads
- Structural adequacy of existing walls and framing
- Condition of existing construction
- Previous modifications and their status
- Opportunities and constraints for expansion

**Code Compliance**

California Building Code requires structural engineering for additions:
- Seismic design requirements
- Gravity load calculations
- Connection design
- Foundation adequacy verification
- PE-stamped plans for permits
