Engineers design repairs suited to specific conditions:
- Repair methods matched to problem cause
- Solutions appropriate for soil conditions
- Cost-effective approaches
- Long-term performance focus
- Code-compliant designs

**Permit Compliance**

Many foundation repairs require permits:
- PE-stamped plans for permit approval
- Compliance with California Building Code
- Documentation for property records
- Protection for property transactions

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I know if I need foundation repair?**

Signs of potential foundation problems include: cracks in walls or foundation, doors and windows that stick, uneven floors, gaps between walls and floors, and visible foundation damage. Not all signs indicate serious problems—engineering assessment determines severity and appropriate response.

**Is a structural engineer the same as a foundation repair company?**

No. Structural engineers are licensed professionals who assess conditions and design repairs. Foundation repair companies perform construction work. Getting independent engineering assessment before hiring repair contractors ensures you get objective recommendations.

**How long does foundation repair engineering take?**

Initial assessment typically takes 1-2 weeks including site visit and report. Design for simple repairs may take 2-3 weeks additional; complex repairs may take 4-6 weeks. Timeline depends on investigation needs and repair complexity.

**Do foundation repairs require permits in Tustin?**

Many foundation repairs require permits from the City of Tustin. Permits are typically required for pier installation, foundation replacement, and significant structural repairs. Minor crack repairs may not require permits. Your engineer can advise on specific requirements.

**Will foundation problems affect my home's value?**

Foundation problems can affect property value and create issues during real estate transactions. However, properly repaired foundations with engineering documentation may satisfy buyer and lender concerns. Documentation of repairs and engineering involvement provides assurance for future transactions.

**Should I get foundation inspection before buying a home?**

Yes, foundation inspection by a structural engineer is recommended before purchasing homes, particularly older homes or those showing signs of foundation issues. Engineering assessment provides objective evaluation of conditions and repair needs.

**What causes foundation cracks?**

Foundation cracks result from various causes including settlement, expansive soil movement, shrinkage during concrete curing, overloading, seismic events, and thermal movement. Engineering assessment determines the cause and whether repair is needed.
