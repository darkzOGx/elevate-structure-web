- Building automation and controls
- Energy recovery and efficiency systems

**Electrical Engineering**

Electrical engineering for buildings includes:
- Power distribution systems
- Lighting design and controls
- Emergency and standby power
- Fire alarm and detection systems
- Low-voltage and communications systems

**Plumbing Engineering**

Plumbing engineering for buildings includes:
- Domestic water systems
- Sanitary waste and vent systems
- Storm drainage systems
