## Frequently Asked Questions

**When do I need civil engineering?**

Civil engineering is typically required for new construction, significant site modifications, projects requiring grading permits, commercial development, and any project needing Water Quality Management Plans.

**What is a Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP)?**

A WQMP is a stormwater management plan required by Orange County for most development projects. It identifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) for treating stormwater runoff and ensures long-term maintenance. Most projects over 2,500 square feet of impervious surface require WQMPs.

**Do residential projects need civil engineering?**

Residential projects often need civil engineering for grading plans, drainage design, driveway permits, and WQMP compliance. Requirements depend on project scope and local regulations. Simple projects may need minimal civil work; larger projects require comprehensive civil engineering.

**How does civil engineering coordinate with structural engineering?**

Civil and structural engineering coordinate for building pad elevations, foundation drainage, retaining walls, and site improvements adjacent to buildings. Integrated engineering services ensure proper coordination between disciplines.

**What information do I need to start civil engineering?**

Helpful information includes site survey, architectural or building plans, geotechnical report (if available), project scope description, and permit requirements. We can advise on specific requirements during initial consultation.

**How long does civil engineering take?**

Simple residential projects may take 2-4 weeks; commercial projects typically take 4-8 weeks. Permit processing adds additional time depending on agency workload.
