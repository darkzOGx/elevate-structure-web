## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I find a civil engineer near me in San Dimas?

Search for civil engineers serving San Dimas and the LA County Foothills, verify California PE licensure, check reviews and site development experience, and contact firms for consultations. AAA Engineering Design serves San Dimas with local engineers providing comprehensive civil engineering services.

### What does a civil engineer do for residential projects?

Civil engineers for residential projects design grading to establish building pads and drainage patterns, design drainage systems to manage stormwater, coordinate utility connections, and prepare site plans for permit approval. For hillside properties, civil engineering addresses slope stability and erosion control.

### How much does civil engineering cost in San Dimas?

Civil engineering in San Dimas typically costs $3,000-$10,000 for residential site work and $10,000-$35,000+ for commercial developments. Costs vary based on site size, topography, and project complexity. Hillside sites typically require more extensive engineering.

### Do I need civil engineering for a home addition?

Home additions may require civil engineering if they significantly affect site drainage, require grading modifications, or trigger stormwater management requirements. Building departments determine specific requirements based on project scope and site conditions.

### What is a grading plan?

A grading plan shows proposed finished grades for a construction project, including cut and fill quantities, slope configurations, drainage patterns, and retaining walls. Grading plans are required for permits when projects modify existing topography.

### How long does civil engineering take?

Civil engineering typically takes 4-8 weeks for residential projects and 8-16 weeks for commercial developments, depending on project complexity. Timeline includes site evaluation, design, plan preparation, and coordination with other disciplines.

### What is LID in civil engineering?

LID (Low Impact Development) refers to stormwater management approaches that infiltrate, filter, or reuse runoff near its source rather than conveying it off-site. California increasingly requires LID features for new development. Civil engineers design compliant LID systems.

### Does AAA Engineering coordinate with surveyors and geotechnical engineers?

Yes, AAA Engineering coordinates with surveyors for topographic surveys and with geotechnical engineers for soil and slope stability recommendations. This coordination ensures civil engineering designs are based on accurate site information and appropriate geotechnical parameters.
