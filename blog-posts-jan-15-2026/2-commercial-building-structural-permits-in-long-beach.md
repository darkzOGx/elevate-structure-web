**Updated: January 2026**

Navigating commercial building structural permits in Long Beach requires understanding both California Building Code requirements and the specific procedures of the Long Beach Development Services Department. Our licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of experience specialize in preparing PE-stamped structural plans that meet Long Beach's stringent requirements, helping commercial property owners, developers, and contractors achieve permit approval efficiently.

As Los Angeles County's second-largest city and home to one of the nation's busiest ports, Long Beach has a diverse commercial building stock ranging from historic downtown structures to modern port-adjacent industrial facilities. Understanding the structural permit process is essential for any commercial construction, renovation, or tenant improvement project in this dynamic coastal city.

## What Are Commercial Building Structural Permits in Long Beach?

Commercial building structural permits are official authorizations from the Long Beach Development Services Department that allow construction work involving structural modifications to commercial properties. These permits ensure that all structural work complies with California Building Code requirements, protecting building occupants and the public from unsafe construction.

In Long Beach, structural permits are required for any work that affects the load-bearing capacity, lateral resistance, or structural integrity of a commercial building. This includes new construction, additions, tenant improvements involving structural modifications, seismic retrofits, and foundation repairs. The permit process involves plan submittal, plan check review, permit issuance, and inspections during construction.

Long Beach's location along the coast and within a seismically active region means structural permits receive particular scrutiny for compliance with seismic design requirements and coastal construction standards. Commercial buildings must demonstrate adequate resistance to earthquake forces and, in some areas, consideration of coastal flooding and sea-level rise impacts.

## What Types of Commercial Projects Require Structural Permits?

Understanding which projects require structural permits helps commercial property owners plan projects appropriately and avoid costly delays from unpermitted work.

**New Commercial Construction**

All new commercial buildings in Long Beach require structural permits as part of the overall building permit package. Structural plans must be prepared by a California-licensed Professional Engineer and demonstrate compliance with California Building Code requirements for the building's occupancy type, size, and location.

**Commercial Building Additions**

Additions to existing commercial buildings require structural permits addressing both the new construction and its connection to the existing structure. Engineers must analyze the existing building's capacity to support additional loads and design connections that properly transfer forces between old and new construction.

**Tenant Improvement Projects**

Many tenant improvement projects require structural permits, particularly those involving:
- Removal or modification of load-bearing walls
- New openings in structural walls or floors
- Installation of heavy equipment requiring structural support
- Mezzanine or platform construction
