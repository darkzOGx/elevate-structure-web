Yes, by defining clear project scope, providing complete information upfront, allowing reasonable timelines, and avoiding scope changes mid-project.

### Why do structural engineering prices vary so much?
Prices vary based on firm overhead, geographic location, project complexity, and scope of services. Always compare apples to apples.

Yes, our initial phone or video consultations are completely free with no obligation. We'll discuss your project and provide a detailed quote.
