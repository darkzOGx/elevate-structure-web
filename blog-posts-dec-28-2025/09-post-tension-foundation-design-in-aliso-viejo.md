Post-tension foundation design in Aliso Viejo offers superior performance for residential and commercial slab-on-grade foundations, particularly in expansive soil conditions common throughout South Orange County. Our licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of foundation engineering experience serve homeowners and developers throughout Aliso Viejo, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo, and surrounding communities.

Post-tensioned (PT) foundations use high-strength steel tendons stretched after concrete placement to create a compression force that resists cracking and differential movement. This technology is particularly valuable in Orange County's expansive clay soils, providing durable, crack-resistant foundations.

## What Is Post-Tension Foundation Design?

**Direct Answer:** Post-tension foundation design involves engineering concrete slab foundations reinforced with high-strength steel tendons that are stressed after concrete curing. This creates a compressed, crack-resistant slab system ideal for expansive soils. In California, PT foundations require PE-stamped design meeting CBC and PTI requirements.

Post-tensioned foundations offer key advantages:
- **Crack resistance** through compressive stressing
- **Reduced slab thickness** compared to conventional slabs
- **Expansive soil performance** with better deflection control
- **Span capability** for larger unsupported areas
- **Long-term durability** with minimal maintenance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When are post-tension foundations recommended?
PT foundations are recommended for expansive soils, large open floor plans, sites prone to differential settlement, or when enhanced crack control is desired.

### Are PT foundations more expensive than conventional slabs?
PT foundations typically cost 10-20% more than conventional slabs but often provide better long-term value through reduced cracking and maintenance.

### How thick are post-tension foundation slabs?
Residential PT slabs are typically 4-6 inches thick, significantly thinner than conventional reinforced slabs which often require 6-10 inches for similar performance.

### Can PT foundations be modified or cut after construction?
Modifying PT slabs requires careful engineering to avoid cutting tendons. Locating tendons before any cutting or drilling is essential.

### What happens if a PT tendon is damaged?
Damaged tendons can sometimes be repaired or replaced, but this requires specialized engineering evaluation. Preventive measures include marking tendon locations and avoiding slab penetrations.

### Do PT foundations require special inspection?
Yes, PT foundations require special inspection during tendon stressing to verify proper force application and elongation measurements.
