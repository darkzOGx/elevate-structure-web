## What Is Shopping Center Structural Engineering?

Shopping centers present unique structural challenges:
- **Large open floor plans** with minimal interior columns
- **High ceiling heights** for retail visibility
- **Storefront systems** that integrate with structural frames
- **Tenant flexibility** requiring adaptable structural configurations
- **Loading dock requirements** for delivery operations
