## What Should You Do After an Earthquake in Pasadena?

**Direct Answer:** After an earthquake in Pasadena, first ensure personal safety and evacuate if you see obvious damage, smell gas, or hear unusual sounds. Check for injuries and call 911 if needed. If safe, photograph visible damage from a safe distance. Do not enter damaged buildings. Contact your insurance company to open a claim. Then call a licensed structural engineer for professional assessment to determine if your building is safe and what repairs are needed.

**Immediate Post-Earthquake Steps**

**First 10 Minutes:**
1. Ensure personal safety—move to safe area
2. Check for injuries, call 911 if needed
3. If indoors in damaged building, evacuate carefully
4. Watch for hazards: broken glass, fallen objects
5. Check for gas leaks (smell, hissing sounds)
6. Turn off gas at meter if you suspect leak

**First Hour:**
1. Account for all family members/employees
2. Don't enter buildings that appear damaged
3. Photograph visible damage from outside
4. Listen to emergency broadcasts
5. Check on neighbors if safe to do so

**First Day:**
1. Contact your insurance company
2. Document all damage with photos and notes
3. Call a structural engineer for assessment
4. Don't start repairs without engineering guidance
5. Arrange temporary housing if needed

**Critical Safety Rule:**

If you observe any of the following, do NOT enter the building:
- Visible leaning or tilting
- Major cracks in walls or foundation
- Partially collapsed sections
- Chimney damage or separation
- Strong gas smell
- Significant water damage from broken pipes

## What Does an Earthquake Damage Assessment Include in Pasadena?

**Direct Answer:** An earthquake damage structural assessment in Pasadena includes exterior inspection of foundation, walls, roof, and chimney; interior inspection of structural elements, cracks, and floor level changes; safety determination (safe to occupy, limited entry, or unsafe); damage documentation with photographs and measurements; analysis of damage severity and probable cause; repair recommendations and cost estimates; and a written report suitable for insurance claims and permit applications.

**Exterior Assessment**

**Foundation Inspection:**
- Visible cracking or displacement
- Separation from structure above
- Ground settlement or upheaval
- Access issues from ground movement

**Wall Evaluation:**
- Crack patterns (shear cracks indicate seismic damage)
- Separation at corners or connections
- Out-of-plumb conditions (leaning)
- Stucco or veneer damage

**Roof and Chimney:**
- Chimney damage or separation
- Roof structure visible distortion
- Fallen tiles or damaged roofing
- Connection integrity

**Interior Assessment**

**Structural Elements:**
- Visible framing damage
- Connection failures
- Floor level changes
- Ceiling damage patterns

**Crack Documentation:**
- Location and pattern
- Width measurements
- Relationship to structure
- New vs. pre-existing

**Building Systems:**
- Door and window operation
- Utility function and damage
- Fire and life safety systems

**Safety Determination**

After assessment, we provide a safety rating:
- **Safe for Occupancy**: No structural damage affecting safety
- **Limited Entry (Yellow Tag equivalent)**: Some areas safe, others restricted
- **Unsafe (Red Tag equivalent)**: Building should not be occupied

## What Types of Earthquake Damage Occur in Pasadena Buildings?

**Direct Answer:** Earthquake damage in Pasadena buildings includes foundation cracking and displacement, cripple wall failure in older homes, soft-story collapse in multi-family buildings, chimney damage and collapse, unreinforced masonry failure in historic buildings, shear cracking in walls, connection failures at framing joints, and damage to non-structural elements like chimneys and parapets. The type of damage depends on building age, construction type, and earthquake characteristics.

**Common Damage in Historic Pasadena Homes**

Pasadena's Craftsman and historic homes face specific vulnerabilities:

**Cripple Wall Failure:**
- Short wood-frame walls between foundation and first floor
- Lack of adequate bracing
- Can cause homes to slide off foundations
- Common in pre-1950 homes without retrofit

**Foundation Connection Issues:**
- Unbolted sill plates
- House not secured to foundation
- Can cause sliding in moderate earthquakes
- Retrofittable with anchor bolts

**Chimney Damage:**
- Unreinforced masonry chimneys
- Common in homes of all ages
- Can collapse onto roof or ground
- Particularly dangerous during shaking

**Commercial and Multi-Family Damage**

**Soft-Story Damage:**
- Buildings with parking or retail at ground level
- Weak ground floors can pancake
- Common in 1960s-1980s apartment buildings
- Pasadena has mandatory retrofit program

**Unreinforced Masonry:**
- Historic commercial buildings
- Brick and stone without steel reinforcement
- High collapse risk in earthquakes
- Many in Old Town Pasadena retrofitted

**Tilt-Up Damage:**
- Industrial and commercial buildings
- Wall-to-roof connection failures
- Can result in wall collapse
- Common issue in larger earthquakes

## Frequently Asked Questions: Earthquake Damage Assessment in Pasadena

### How soon after an earthquake should I have my Pasadena building assessed?
You should have your building assessed as soon as possible if you observe any damage—cracks, doors not closing, chimney damage, or any structural concerns. For buildings with obvious damage, do not occupy until assessed. Even without visible damage, assessment provides peace of mind and documents the pre-repair condition for insurance purposes.

### How much does post-earthquake structural assessment cost in Pasadena?
Post-earthquake structural assessment in Pasadena typically costs $1,500-$6,000 depending on building size and damage extent. Safety assessments run $1,500-$2,500, comprehensive damage evaluations $2,500-$6,000. These costs are usually covered by earthquake insurance policies as part of the claims process.

### Will my homeowner's insurance cover earthquake damage assessment?
Standard homeowner's insurance typically does NOT cover earthquake damage or assessment. You need a separate earthquake insurance policy (CEA or private). If you have earthquake insurance, assessment costs are typically covered. Check your specific policy for coverage details.

### What's the difference between a red tag and a yellow tag?
A red tag means the building is unsafe for any occupancy—no entry permitted. A yellow tag means restricted use—some areas may be occupied while others are restricted. Both require structural engineering assessment and repairs before full clearance. Our engineers work with the Pasadena Building Department to resolve both situations.

### Can earthquake damage to historic Pasadena homes be repaired?
Yes, most earthquake damage to historic Pasadena homes can be repaired while preserving historic character. We have extensive experience with Craftsman, Period Revival, and other historic styles. Repairs can be designed to meet both structural requirements and historic preservation standards, often using methods acceptable to the Secretary of Interior's Standards.

### How do I know if cracks are from the earthquake or were pre-existing?
A structural engineer can often determine crack age by examining crack characteristics, debris in cracks, paint damage patterns, and documented pre-earthquake condition. For insurance purposes, having photos from before the earthquake helps establish baseline condition. We document all damage and provide professional opinions on cause.

### What should I do if my chimney was damaged in an earthquake?
Earthquake-damaged chimneys are common and can be dangerous. Do not use the fireplace until assessed. Keep people away from areas where chimney could fall. Have a structural engineer assess damage extent. Repair options range from reattachment to complete rebuilding, depending on damage severity.

### How long does it take to get a structural engineering report after an earthquake?
Standard post-earthquake assessment reports are typically delivered within 3-5 business days. Rush service is available for insurance deadlines or time-sensitive situations. For widespread earthquake events affecting many buildings, report delivery times may extend due to high demand.
