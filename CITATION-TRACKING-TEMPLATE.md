## AAA Engineering Design - Local SEO Citation Building

---

## What Are Citations?

**Citations** are online mentions of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) on other websites. They are critical for local SEO because:

1. **Google uses citations to verify your business information**
2. **Consistent NAP across the web builds trust**
3. **Citations from authoritative sites improve local rankings**
4. **More citations = better visibility in local search and Google Maps**

   - "Can AAA Engineering Design be added to your referral list?"
   - "Do you have a website directory of local engineers?"

2. **Email follow-up** with your information:
   ```
   Subject: Request to Add AAA Engineering Design to Approved Engineer List

   Dear [City] Building Department,

   I am writing to request that AAA Engineering Design be added to your list of approved structural engineers serving [City] residents and contractors.

   Our information:
