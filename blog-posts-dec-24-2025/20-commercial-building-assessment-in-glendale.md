## What Are Common Findings in Glendale Commercial Assessments?

Commercial building assessments in Glendale commonly identify several types of conditions.

**Finding 1: Seismic Deficiencies**

**Issue:** Many Glendale commercial buildings predate modern seismic codes and require retrofit to meet current requirements or comply with Glendale's mandatory retrofit ordinance.

**Typical Conditions:**
- Unreinforced masonry (URM) construction
- Non-ductile concrete frames
- Soft-story conditions in mixed-use buildings
- Inadequate wall-to-diaphragm connections

**Implications:** Seismic retrofit requirements may significantly impact building value, use, and required investment.

**Finding 2: Deferred Maintenance Issues**

**Issue:** Older commercial buildings often show structural deterioration from deferred maintenance affecting structural capacity or safety.

**Typical Conditions:**
- Corroded steel elements
- Deteriorated wood framing
- Settlement or foundation issues
- Water damage to structural elements

**Implications:** Repair costs should factor into acquisition pricing and capital planning.

**Finding 3: Prior Modification Concerns**

**Issue:** Buildings modified over decades may have unpermitted work or modifications affecting structural integrity.

**Typical Conditions:**
- Removed structural walls
- Added openings without engineering
- Overloaded floor systems
- Altered lateral systems

**Implications:** Corrective work may be required for code compliance or to address safety concerns.
