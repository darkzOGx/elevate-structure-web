## What Are Common Office Complex Challenges in Irvine?

Office complex development in Irvine presents challenges requiring experienced engineering solutions.

**Challenge 1: Flexible Floor Plate Design**

**Problem:** Office tenants require flexibility to configure space for varying needs, requiring structural systems that don't constrain interior layouts.

**Irvine Example:** A multi-tenant office building needed column-free spans exceeding 40 feet to accommodate both open-plan and private office configurations.

**Solution:** Longer span structural systems using post-tensioned concrete or steel framing, with strategic core placement and optimized column grids.

**Challenge 2: Parking Integration**

**Problem:** Irvine's parking requirements often necessitate structured parking, requiring careful integration with office buildings and efficient structural design.

**Solution:** Purpose-designed parking structures with appropriate structural systems, efficient ramping, and seamless connection to office buildings.

**Challenge 3: Phased Development**

**Problem:** Office complexes often develop in phases over multiple years, requiring structural planning for future connections and consistent design.

**Solution:** Master structural planning addressing future phases, standardized systems enabling efficient construction, and provision for future connections.
