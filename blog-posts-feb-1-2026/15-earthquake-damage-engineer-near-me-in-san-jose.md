## Frequently Asked Questions

### How soon after an earthquake should I get a structural assessment in San Jose?

Request assessment immediately if you observe any visible damage, difficulty with doors/windows, or have safety concerns. Even without visible damage, assessment within 1-2 weeks after significant earthquakes is prudent. Our team provides rapid response for post-earthquake evaluations throughout San Jose.

### How much does earthquake damage assessment cost in San Jose?

Residential earthquake damage assessment in San Jose typically costs $800-$1,500 for single-family homes and $1,500-$3,500 for multi-family buildings. This includes on-site inspection, damage documentation, safety determination, and written report with repair recommendations. Emergency response may include additional fees.

### Does homeowner's insurance cover earthquake damage assessment?

Standard homeowner's insurance typically does not cover earthquake damage or assessment. Separate earthquake insurance is required. If you have earthquake insurance, assessment costs are typically covered as part of the claim process. We provide insurance-ready documentation and can communicate directly with adjusters.

### What is the difference between earthquake damage repair and seismic retrofit?

Earthquake damage repair addresses damage that has already occurred—restoring the structure to pre-earthquake condition. Seismic retrofit proactively strengthens a structure to better withstand future earthquakes. After earthquake damage, both may be needed: repair the damage and upgrade to prevent similar damage in future events.

### Should I retrofit my San Jose home even without earthquake damage?

We recommend seismic retrofit for San Jose homes built before 1980, especially those with raised foundations and cripple walls. Given San Jose's significant seismic risk from multiple fault systems, proactive retrofit ($6,000-$14,000 typical) provides protection that reactive repairs after damage cannot match.
