## What is Mandatory Retrofit Compliance in West Hollywood?

**Direct Answer:** Mandatory retrofit compliance in West Hollywood involves required structural upgrades to "soft-story" buildings—typically older apartment buildings with weak ground floors used for parking. The City of West Hollywood's seismic retrofit ordinance establishes deadlines for property owners to complete engineering design and construction, with penalties for non-compliance.

West Hollywood's dense multi-family housing stock includes many buildings constructed before modern seismic codes. These soft-story buildings have collapsed in past earthquakes, prompting the city to require upgrades.

Our engineers provide [complete retrofit engineering solutions](/services/structural-engineering) that achieve compliance efficiently.
