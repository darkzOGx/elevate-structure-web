Mandatory retrofit engineering addresses West Hollywood's seismic safety ordinance requiring structural strengthening of vulnerable apartment buildings. Our licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of combined experience specialize in soft-story retrofit design that meets City of West Hollywood requirements while minimizing cost and tenant disruption. Understanding WeHo's mandatory retrofit program is essential for building owners facing compliance deadlines.

West Hollywood's iconic density includes many wood-frame apartment buildings with vulnerable first floors—buildings that perform poorly in earthquakes. The City's mandatory retrofit program aims to protect thousands of residents by requiring structural upgrades to these at-risk buildings.

## What Is Mandatory Retrofit Engineering in West Hollywood?

**Direct Answer:**
Mandatory retrofit engineering encompasses the structural evaluation and strengthening of existing buildings to meet West Hollywood's seismic safety ordinance. For soft-story buildings, this involves adding steel moment frames or shear walls to weak ground floors, upgrading connections, and improving foundation anchorage—all designed to prevent collapse during major earthquakes while meeting City compliance requirements and deadlines.

West Hollywood's ordinance targets buildings that are:

- Wood-frame construction
- Multiple stories with weak ground floors
- Built before modern seismic codes
- Identified on the City's required retrofit list

Building owners face specific deadlines for compliance, with penalties for non-compliance including daily fines and potential occupancy restrictions.

## What Retrofit Services Are Available in West Hollywood?

**Direct Answer:**
West Hollywood retrofit services include building screening and identification, structural evaluation, retrofit design with cost-optimized options, PE-stamped construction documents, permit support, and construction administration. Our engineers design solutions meeting City requirements while minimizing construction cost and tenant impact.
