## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I need foundation repair engineering or just a contractor?

California requires PE-stamped plans for structural foundation repairs. While contractors can observe problems, licensed structural engineers diagnose causes, design repairs, and certify the work meets code requirements. Always get an engineering assessment before contracting repairs.

### How long do foundation repairs take in Escondido?

Foundation repair timelines in Escondido vary by scope: minor crack repairs take 1-2 days, moderate underpinning takes 1-2 weeks, and major foundation work may require 3-6 weeks. Add 2-4 weeks for engineering and permitting before construction begins.

### Will my homeowner's insurance cover foundation repairs?

Standard homeowner's insurance typically excludes foundation settlement and soil movement. Policies may cover foundation damage from covered perils like plumbing leaks. Review your policy and consult your insurer about specific coverage.

### Can foundation problems be prevented in Escondido?

Many foundation problems can be prevented or minimized by: maintaining proper drainage away from the foundation, keeping soil moisture consistent, managing tree root growth, addressing plumbing leaks promptly, and maintaining gutters and downspouts.

### How much does foundation underpinning cost in Escondido?

Foundation underpinning in Escondido typically costs $1,500-$3,500 per steel push pier or $1,800-$4,000 per helical pier installed. Most homes requiring underpinning need 8-20 piers, resulting in total construction costs of $15,000-$60,000 plus engineering.
