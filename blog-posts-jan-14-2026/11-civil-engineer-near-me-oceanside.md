## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a civil engineer for my Oceanside project?

Oceanside requires civil engineering for: grading permits involving significant earthwork, new driveways or site improvements, stormwater management systems, utility connections, and commercial or subdivision development. Single-family homes with minimal grading may not require full civil plans.

### How long does civil engineering permitting take in Oceanside?

Civil engineering permitting in Oceanside typically takes 2-4 months for grading permits and 4-8 months for larger development projects. Timeline varies based on project complexity, agency coordination, and environmental review requirements.

### What is a SWPPP and do I need one in Oceanside?

A SWPPP (Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan) is required for Oceanside construction projects disturbing one acre or more. It identifies erosion control measures, construction BMPs, and inspection requirements. Our civil engineers prepare SWPPPs as part of grading permit packages.

### Can you help with Oceanside coastal development permits?

Yes, we provide civil engineering for Oceanside coastal zone projects requiring California Coastal Commission review. We prepare grading and drainage plans that address coastal development requirements including public access, visual resources, and water quality.

### What's the difference between civil engineering and structural engineering?

Civil engineering addresses site work: grading, drainage, utilities, and site improvements. Structural engineering addresses building structures: foundations, framing, and load-bearing systems. AAA Engineering Design provides both services for integrated project delivery.
