## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need separate MEP engineers or one firm for all three disciplines?

You can hire separate engineers or use a full-service firm like AAA Engineering Design that provides all three MEP disciplines. Integrated services typically provide better coordination and may cost less than separate consultants.

### How does MEP engineering coordinate with structural engineering?

MEP and structural engineering must coordinate for: penetrations through structural elements, equipment support loads, seismic bracing of systems, and routing conflicts. AAA Engineering Design provides both structural and MEP services, ensuring seamless coordination.

### What Title 24 documentation do I need for a Carlsbad building permit?

Carlsbad building permits require: CF-1R (residential) or NRCC/NRCI/LMCC (commercial) compliance forms, CF-2R installation certificates, and CF-3R verification. Our MEP engineers prepare all required Title 24 documentation.

### How long does MEP engineering take for a custom Carlsbad home?

MEP engineering for a custom Carlsbad home typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. Coordination with structural and architectural design may extend this if designs are developing concurrently. Permit review adds 2-4 weeks.
