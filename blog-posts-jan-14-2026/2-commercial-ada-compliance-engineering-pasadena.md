## What is Commercial ADA Compliance Engineering?

Commercial ADA compliance engineering involves structural modifications to make existing Pasadena buildings accessible to people with disabilities. Our California PE-licensed engineers design ramps, elevator additions, accessible restrooms, and other structural modifications that meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and California's more stringent accessibility standards.

Pasadena's historic downtown and older commercial buildings often require significant structural work to achieve accessibility compliance. With the city's commitment to preserving historic character while ensuring equal access, structural engineers must balance accessibility requirements with architectural preservation.

**Quick Answer:** Commercial ADA compliance engineering in Pasadena typically costs $5,000-$50,000 for structural engineering, depending on modification scope. Ramp additions, elevator installations, and restroom renovations each require PE-stamped structural plans for Pasadena permit approval.

## Why Pasadena Commercial Buildings Need ADA Engineering

### California Accessibility Requirements

California's accessibility standards exceed federal ADA requirements. The California Building Code (CBC) Chapter 11B establishes requirements for path of travel, ramp specifications, elevator requirements, restroom accessibility, and parking signage.

### Pasadena-Specific Considerations

Pasadena's commercial building stock includes many structures built before accessibility requirements existed, including historic Old Town buildings, mid-century office buildings, retail storefronts, and mixed-use buildings.

## ADA Compliance Engineering Services

### Exterior Accessibility Modifications

AAA Engineering Design provides structural engineering for exterior accessibility improvements in Pasadena including accessible ramp design, curb ramp engineering, entry platform design, and handrail systems.

### Elevator and Lift Engineering

Adding elevators to existing Pasadena buildings requires specialized structural engineering including elevator pit foundations, hoistway framing, machine room support, and platform lifts.

### Interior Accessibility Modifications

Interior accessibility improvements often require structural work including restroom renovations, doorway widening, floor level changes, and accessible route creation.

## ADA Compliance Engineering Costs in Pasadena

| Project Type | Engineering Cost | Construction Estimate |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Exterior Ramp (under 30") | $3,000-$6,000 | $15,000-$35,000 |
| Exterior Ramp (over 30") | $5,000-$10,000 | $35,000-$75,000 |
| LULA Elevator Addition | $8,000-$15,000 | $80,000-$150,000 |
| Full Elevator Addition | $15,000-$35,000 | $150,000-$350,000 |
| Accessible Restroom | $3,000-$8,000 | $25,000-$60,000 |

## Pasadena Historic District Considerations

Many Pasadena commercial buildings fall within historic districts requiring Design Review including Old Pasadena Historic District, South Lake Avenue, and Playhouse District. Our engineers coordinate with Pasadena's Design Commission to develop structural solutions that meet both accessibility and historic preservation requirements.

## The ADA Compliance Engineering Process

### Phase 1: Accessibility Assessment (1-2 weeks)

Conduct existing conditions survey, identify accessibility barriers, review path of travel requirements, and coordinate with Certified Access Specialist (CASp).

### Phase 2: Schematic Design (2-4 weeks)

Develop modification options, prepare preliminary structural concepts, estimate construction costs, and submit for Design Review if required.

### Phase 3: Construction Documents (3-6 weeks)

Complete structural calculations, prepare PE-stamped drawings, write specifications, and coordinate with architect and CASp.

## California Accessibility Litigation Protection

California leads the nation in accessibility lawsuits against commercial property owners. Proactive ADA compliance provides litigation protection, CASp inspection benefits, early resolution options, and business continuity.
