## What is Residential Foundation Repair Engineering?

Residential foundation repair engineering involves the structural evaluation and design of repairs for damaged or failing home foundations. Our California PE-licensed structural engineers assess Anaheim home foundations, determine the cause of distress, and design repair solutions that restore structural integrity and prevent future problems.

Anaheim's diverse housing stock—from 1950s ranch homes to modern construction—experiences foundation problems from expansive soils, poor drainage, and age-related deterioration. With over 117,000 single-family homes in the city, foundation repair engineering is a frequent need for Anaheim homeowners.

**Quick Answer:** Residential foundation repair engineering in Anaheim typically costs $3,500-$12,000 for assessment and design, with repair construction costs ranging from $15,000-$75,000 depending on damage extent and repair method selected.

## Why Anaheim Homes Need Foundation Repair Engineering
