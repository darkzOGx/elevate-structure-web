## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I really need a structural engineer for my Corona home addition?

Yes, Corona requires PE-stamped structural plans for most home additions. The Building Division requires engineering for any construction affecting the structural system, including room additions, second stories, and significant alterations. Attempting to permit without engineering typically results in rejection.

### How long does it take to get structural plans for a home addition in Corona?

Structural plans for Corona home additions typically take 2-4 weeks for design and drafting after initial site evaluation. Complex second-story additions may take 3-5 weeks. Corona Building Division plan check adds 2-4 weeks for initial review.

### Can my existing foundation support a second story addition?

Many Corona homes can support second-story additions with proper engineering. Our assessment evaluates existing foundation size, reinforcement, and soil conditions. Some homes require foundation reinforcement, while others can accept second floors with minimal modifications.

### What's the difference between a structural engineer and an architect for additions?

Structural engineers design the structural system—foundations, framing, connections—with PE-stamped calculations proving code compliance. Architects design layout, aesthetics, and coordinate overall design. Many Corona additions need both, though some projects combine structural and architectural in one package.

### Will a home addition affect my property taxes in Corona?

Yes, home additions that add permitted square footage will increase your Riverside County assessed value and property taxes. However, Proposition 13 limits annual increases to 2% of the new assessed value. Consult with a tax professional for specific impacts.
