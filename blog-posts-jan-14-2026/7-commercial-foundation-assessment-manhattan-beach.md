## What is a Commercial Foundation Assessment?

A commercial foundation assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of an existing building's foundation system by a licensed structural engineer. Our California PE-licensed engineers assess Manhattan Beach commercial property foundations to identify deficiencies, evaluate renovation potential, and provide recommendations for repairs or upgrades.

Manhattan Beach's premium commercial real estate—with property values among the highest in Los Angeles County—makes foundation condition critical for investment decisions. The city's sandy coastal soils and groundwater conditions create unique foundation challenges requiring specialized evaluation.

**Quick Answer:** Commercial foundation assessments in Manhattan Beach typically cost $4,000-$12,000 depending on building size and assessment scope. Standard assessments take 2-3 weeks including site inspection, analysis, and PE-certified report delivery.

## Why Manhattan Beach Commercial Foundations Need Assessment

### Common Assessment Triggers

Property owners commission foundation assessments for property acquisitions, refinancing requirements, tenant improvement planning, settlement concerns, insurance requirements, and renovation planning.

### Manhattan Beach Foundation Challenges

Manhattan Beach's coastal location creates specific foundation concerns including sandy soils, high groundwater, liquefaction potential, corrosive environment, older construction, and dense development effects.

## Types of Foundation Assessments

### Visual Condition Assessment

Standard foundation evaluation includes exterior inspection, interior inspection, settlement evidence, moisture indicators, material condition, and drainage evaluation.

### Technical Foundation Assessment

Enhanced assessment includes document review, material testing, elevation survey, load analysis, code compliance, and remaining service life projections.

### Pre-Renovation Assessment

Assessment supporting planned modifications includes capacity evaluation, modification feasibility, upgrade requirements, construction constraints, and cost implications.

## What We Evaluate During Assessments

### Foundation Type Identification

Manhattan Beach commercial buildings may have spread footings, continuous footings, mat foundations, deep foundations, or combination systems.

### Concrete Condition Assessment

Concrete foundation evaluation includes surface condition, reinforcement corrosion, carbonation depth, alkali-silica reaction, sulfate attack, and core testing.

### Settlement Analysis

Foundation movement evaluation includes floor elevation survey, crack mapping, historic records, adjacent construction effects, and future projections.

## The Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 days)

Gather available documentation, research permit history, review prior assessments, plan inspection approach.

### Phase 2: Site Inspection (4-8 hours)

Exterior foundation examination, interior accessible areas, photographic documentation, dimensional measurements.

### Phase 3: Analysis (3-7 days)
