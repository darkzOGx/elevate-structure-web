Balboa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and bayfront properties have unique structural requirements:
- Marine-grade materials
- Flood zone compliance

- Higher wind loads

**Luxury Market Expectations:**
Newport Beach's luxury market demands premium engineering. Our quotes reflect the quality and thoroughness expected for properties valued at $2M+.
