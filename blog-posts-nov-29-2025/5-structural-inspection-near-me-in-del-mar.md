In Del Mar, coastal erosion and bluff properties make structural inspections especially important.

## Frequently Asked Questions: Structural Inspections in Del Mar

### How long does a structural inspection take in Del Mar?

On-site inspection typically takes 1-3 hours depending on property size. Larger Del Mar homes (4,000+ sq ft) or properties with crawl spaces, multiple levels, or bluff conditions take longer. Written reports are delivered within 3-5 business days.

### Is a structural inspection different from a home inspection?

Yes. A home inspection is a general overview of all systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, structure). A structural inspection is a focused, detailed evaluation by a licensed engineer specifically examining structural systems. For Del Mar's luxury properties and bluff locations, a PE structural inspection provides deeper analysis than a general home inspection.

### Should I get a structural inspection before buying in Del Mar?

Strongly recommended. Del Mar's $3.5M median home prices and unique coastal/bluff conditions make pre-purchase structural inspection essential due diligence. Hidden foundation issues, bluff erosion, or structural damage can cost hundreds of thousands to repair.
