## Frequently Asked Questions: Licensed Structural Engineers in Manhattan Beach

### How do I verify a structural engineer is licensed in California?

Visit the California Board for Professional Engineers website at bpelsg.ca.gov and use the license lookup tool. Enter the engineer's name or license number to verify their PE license is active and in good standing. Always verify before hiring.

### What's the difference between a licensed PE and a "structural designer"?

A licensed Professional Engineer (PE) has passed state examinations and can legally stamp structural plans. A "structural designer" or unlicensed individual cannot stamp plans, and their work will be rejected by Manhattan Beach Building Department. Only use licensed PEs for structural work.

### Do I need a structural engineer for a small remodel in Manhattan Beach?

If your remodel involves any load-bearing walls, foundation work, or structural modifications, yes—you need a licensed PE. Even seemingly small projects like removing a wall may require PE-stamped calculations. Manhattan Beach building department will specify if engineering is required.
