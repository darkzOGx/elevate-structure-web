# Soft Story Retrofit Engineer in Los Angeles: Ordinance 183893 Compliance Guide 2025

Los Angeles Ordinance 183893 mandates seismic retrofitting for thousands of soft-story buildings across the city—and compliance deadlines are approaching fast. As California-licensed Professional Engineers with 20+ years of soft story retrofit experience, we've helped hundreds of LA property owners achieve compliance efficiently and cost-effectively. Our PE-stamped retrofit plans are designed for Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) approval.

This guide covers everything Los Angeles property owners and managers need to know about soft story retrofit compliance, from identifying if your building is affected to understanding costs, timelines, and the engineering process.

**Why Los Angeles Building Owners Trust AAA Engineering:**
- California Licensed PE (Professional Engineer)
- 100+ soft story retrofits completed in Los Angeles County
- 20+ years serving Los Angeles and Southern California
- PE-stamped plans accepted by LADBS
- Fast turnaround: 2-4 weeks typical for retrofit plans

## What Is a Soft Story Building and Does Ordinance 183893 Apply to You?

**Direct Answer:** A soft story building has a weak first floor—typically parking, tuck-under garages, or large openings—that can collapse during an earthquake. LA Ordinance 183893 requires owners of wood-frame soft story buildings with 3+ stories and 2+ units to retrofit their buildings. Approximately 13,500 Los Angeles buildings are affected. If you received a compliance notice from LADBS, you're required to retrofit.

### Characteristics of Soft Story Buildings

Soft story buildings are identified by:

- **Open Ground Floor**: Parking garages, large retail windows, or open commercial space on the first floor
- **Tuck-Under Parking**: Parking tucked beneath residential units
- **Inadequate Shear Walls**: Missing or insufficient lateral bracing on the ground floor
- **Height**: Three or more stories
- **Age**: Typically built before 1978 (pre-modern seismic codes)

### Why Soft Story Buildings Are Dangerous

During an earthquake, the weak ground floor acts like a hinge, causing catastrophic collapse. The 1994 Northridge earthquake demonstrated this danger when numerous soft story buildings collapsed in Los Angeles, killing residents and causing billions in damage.

The retrofit adds structural elements—steel moment frames, shear walls, or bracing—that strengthen the weak first floor and prevent collapse.

### Los Angeles Ordinance 183893 Requirements

**Buildings Covered:**
- Wood-frame construction
- Two or more dwelling units
- Three or more stories
- Ground floor parking or similar soft story condition
- Permitted for construction before January 1, 1978

**Compliance Timeline:**
Los Angeles established a phased compliance schedule based on building occupancy and use. Most deadlines have passed or are imminent—contact LADBS or our engineers to verify your specific deadline.

## Rent Recovery Under LA's Soft Story Ordinance

**Direct Answer:** Los Angeles allows building owners to recover soft story retrofit costs through rent increases of up to $38/month per unit, spread over a period not exceeding 6 years. RSO (Rent Stabilization Ordinance) buildings must apply to LA Housing Department (LAHD) for the rent increase, while non-RSO buildings can increase rents per lease terms.

### RSO (Rent-Controlled) Buildings

**Application Process:**
1. Complete retrofit with Certificate of Compliance
2. Submit application to LAHD with cost documentation
3. LAHD reviews and approves maximum passthrough amount
4. Increase limited to $38/month maximum
5. Passthrough continues until costs recovered (max 6 years)

**Documentation Required:**
- Final construction costs with invoices
- Engineering fees
- Permit fees
- Certificate of Compliance from LADBS

### Non-RSO Buildings

Non-rent-controlled buildings can recover costs per lease terms, typically through:
- Rent increases at lease renewal
- Capital improvement surcharges
- Negotiated tenant cost sharing

### Financial Planning for Soft Story Retrofits

**Typical Cost Recovery Example (12-unit building):**
- Total retrofit cost: $150,000
- Per-unit cost: $12,500
- Monthly recovery at $38/unit: $456/month total
- Recovery period: Approximately 27 months

## Frequently Asked Questions: Soft Story Retrofit in Los Angeles

### What is the deadline for soft story retrofit in Los Angeles?

Los Angeles Ordinance 183893 established phased deadlines based on building type and occupancy. Most initial deadlines have passed, and buildings now in non-compliance face penalties. Contact LADBS or our engineers to verify your specific deadline status and any extensions that may apply.

### How much does soft story retrofit cost per unit in Los Angeles?

Soft story retrofit costs in Los Angeles average $20,000-$40,000 per unit, depending on building size and retrofit approach. A typical 12-unit building costs $150,000-$200,000 total for engineering and construction. Engineering fees alone range from $5,000-$25,000 depending on complexity.

### Can I pass soft story retrofit costs to tenants in LA?

Yes. Los Angeles allows owners of RSO (rent-controlled) buildings to recover retrofit costs through rent increases of up to $38/month per unit, spread over a maximum of 6 years. You must apply to LAHD after completing the retrofit with proper cost documentation.

### What happens if I don't comply with the soft story ordinance?

Non-compliance with LA Ordinance 183893 can result in citations, fines, and ultimately a building permit restriction that prevents any other permits until the retrofit is completed. Buildings may also face "soft story" disclosure requirements affecting property value and tenant relations.

### How long does soft story retrofit construction take in Los Angeles?

Soft story retrofit construction in Los Angeles typically takes 6-12 weeks for most buildings. Smaller buildings (3-6 units) may complete in 4-6 weeks, while larger buildings (16+ units) may take 10-14 weeks. Most retrofits are completed with tenants in place, though parking disruption is common during construction.

### Do I need to relocate tenants during soft story retrofit?

Most soft story retrofits in Los Angeles are completed with tenants remaining in place. Parking may be temporarily disrupted (typically 1-2 weeks per building section), but unit access is generally maintained. We design retrofits to minimize tenant impact wherever possible.
