Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of combined experience specialize in chimney removal design, floor/ceiling repair engineering, and structural modifications throughout Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, and Orange County.

Many Costa Mesa homeowners choose to remove unused fireplaces to reclaim floor space, eliminate maintenance costs, and modernize home layouts. Proper engineering ensures safe demolition and adequate structural support after removal.

## Why Do You Need a Fireplace Removal Engineer?

**Direct Answer:**
Fireplace removal engineers evaluate structural implications of removing chimneys that may support roof loads, design floor and ceiling repairs after masonry removal, ensure remaining structure has adequate support, and address any load path modifications. In Costa Mesa, engineering prevents common problems like sagging roofs and inadequate floor support.

Fireplaces and chimneys are heavy masonry structures often integrated with home framing. Removal without engineering can damage remaining structure.
