## Frequently Asked Questions

Yes, Rancho Palos Verdes requires geotechnical investigation for most hillside projects to evaluate soil conditions and slope stability.

**How long do hillside projects take to permit?**
Hillside permits in Rancho Palos Verdes typically require 8-16 weeks due to additional reviews for slope stability and geological hazards.

**Can I build on slopes near Portuguese Bend?**
