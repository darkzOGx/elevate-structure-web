**Updated: November 2025**

Electrical engineering design powers the entertainment capital of Burbank, supporting major studios, production facilities, and commercial developments throughout the Media District, downtown, and across Los Angeles County. Our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with over 20 years of experience specialize in power distribution, lighting design, emergency systems, and specialized electrical infrastructure that meets the demanding requirements of entertainment production, commercial buildings, and California's evolving energy codes. Understanding electrical engineering is essential for developers, studio executives, and property owners managing Burbank's unique combination of entertainment industry needs, sustainability mandates, and grid modernization requirements.

With Burbank's role as home to Warner Bros., Disney, NBCUniversal, and numerous production facilities, plus median commercial property values around $900,000, proper electrical design directly impacts operational continuity, production capabilities, and energy efficiency. The city's 17 square miles hosting world-class studios, creative offices, and supporting infrastructure require sophisticated electrical solutions accommodating both traditional and cutting-edge technologies.

## What is Electrical Engineering Design?

Electrical engineering design encompasses the planning, analysis, and specification of power distribution systems, lighting, communications, and specialized electrical infrastructure that safely deliver electricity throughout buildings. In California, licensed Professional Engineers calculate electrical loads, design distribution systems, specify equipment, create lighting layouts, and ensure code compliance for permits and utility coordination.

These critical systems must reliably serve diverse loads from studio production equipment drawing megawatts to sensitive broadcast systems requiring uninterrupted power. Every component—from transformers to branch circuits—demands precise engineering and coordination. Our [MEP engineering services](/services/mep-engineering) integrate electrical design with mechanical and plumbing systems for complete building infrastructure.

The complexity multiplies in Burbank's entertainment facilities where production spaces require massive power capacity, specialized grounding, and isolation from electromagnetic interference. Properties near the Burbank Airport face additional height restrictions affecting equipment placement, while older studios need infrastructure modernization supporting new technologies.

## What Electrical Services Are Available?

Professional electrical engineering services in Burbank include power distribution design, lighting design and controls, emergency and backup power systems, specialized entertainment systems, renewable energy integration, and electrical vehicle charging infrastructure.

Production stages need massive power capacity with company switches and distribution boxes. Our [commercial engineering expertise](/services/commercial) addresses complex distribution requirements.

**Lighting Design Engineering**
Professional lighting design balances aesthetics, functionality, and energy efficiency. We create photometric layouts achieving target illumination levels while minimizing energy use. Title 24 requires sophisticated controls including daylight harvesting and occupancy sensing. Studio facilities need specialized production lighting infrastructure. Office spaces benefit from circadian lighting supporting occupant wellness.

**Emergency Power Systems**
Life safety and business continuity depend on reliable emergency power. We design emergency generators, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and automatic transfer switches. Burbank's entertainment facilities require extensive backup power for broadcast continuity. Data centers need N+1 redundancy. Healthcare facilities must meet strict NEC 517 requirements.

**Entertainment Industry Specialization**
Production facilities require unique electrical infrastructure including stage power distribution, technical power systems, broadcast infrastructure, and post-production facility requirements. We understand entertainment industry standards and practices. Sound stages need quiet power free from harmonics. Edit bays require isolated grounding.

## How Does the Electrical Design Process Work?

The electrical engineering process typically takes 6-10 weeks from initial load analysis to construction documents. The process includes load calculations, system design, coordination, documentation, and permit support. Licensed Professional Engineers ensure code compliance while optimizing system reliability and efficiency.

**Phase 1: Load Analysis (1-2 weeks)**

Comprehensive load analysis establishes power requirements and system capacity. We inventory all electrical equipment and calculate demand loads using NEC methods. Entertainment facilities require detailed production load analysis. Future expansion provisions ensure adequate capacity. Burbank Water & Power coordination confirms service availability.

**Phase 2: System Design (2-3 weeks)**

System design establishes distribution architecture, equipment locations, and routing strategies. We develop single-line diagrams showing power flow from service to loads. Panel schedules detail circuit arrangements. Voltage drop calculations ensure proper operation. Short circuit and arc flash studies address safety requirements.

**Phase 3: Detailed Documentation (3-4 weeks)**

Construction documents provide comprehensive installation instructions. We create detailed plans showing equipment locations, conduit routing, and device layouts. Lighting plans include fixture schedules and control zones. Specifications define quality standards and installation requirements. Coordination with other trades prevents conflicts.

**Phase 4: Permitting and Approvals (2-3 weeks)**

Burbank Building & Safety reviews electrical plans for code compliance. We respond to plan check comments and obtain approvals. Title 24 compliance documentation demonstrates energy code conformance. Burbank Water & Power reviews service and metering requirements. Complex projects may require additional Fire Department review.

## What Are Regional Electrical Considerations?
