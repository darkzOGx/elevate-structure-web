**Updated: November 2025**

Stormwater design engineering plays a crucial role in protecting Hermosa Beach's pristine coastal environment while managing drainage for residential and commercial developments throughout Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, and the South Bay region. Our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with over 20 years of experience specialize in Low Impact Development (LID), NPDES compliance, and innovative stormwater management solutions that meet California's stringent water quality standards. Understanding stormwater engineering requirements is essential for property owners and developers navigating the complex regulatory landscape of coastal Los Angeles County.

With Hermosa Beach's median home value at $1.8 million and its commitment to ocean water quality, proper stormwater design directly impacts project approvals, environmental compliance, and long-term property value. The city's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and strict Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit requirements demand specialized expertise in sustainable stormwater solutions.

## What is Stormwater Design Engineering?

Stormwater design engineering encompasses the planning, analysis, and design of systems that collect, treat, and discharge rainwater runoff from developed properties. In California, licensed Professional Engineers create comprehensive drainage plans showing storm drain systems, retention/detention facilities, water quality treatment devices, and Low Impact Development features required for building permits and Regional Water Quality Control Board compliance.

These systems must effectively manage the 85th percentile storm event while treating runoff to meet Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements for Santa Monica Bay. Every component—from bioswales to proprietary treatment units—requires careful sizing and placement. Our [civil engineering services](/services/civil-engineering) team integrates stormwater design with overall site development plans.

The challenge intensifies in Hermosa Beach's densely developed coastal environment, where limited space, high groundwater, and beach proximity complicate traditional stormwater management approaches. Properties along The Strand or near Pier Avenue require innovative solutions balancing water quality protection with practical construction constraints.

## What Stormwater Services Are Available?

Professional stormwater engineering services in Hermosa Beach include hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, LID design and optimization, Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) preparation, drainage system design, NPDES permit compliance, and construction stormwater pollution prevention planning.

**Low Impact Development (LID) Design**
LID techniques mimic natural hydrology by capturing and treating runoff at its source. We design bioretention cells, permeable pavement, infiltration galleries, and rainwater harvesting systems tailored to Hermosa Beach sites. Beachfront properties often utilize modular wetland systems and underground infiltration chambers where space is limited.

**Water Quality Management Plans**
WQMPs document how projects will meet post-construction stormwater requirements. We prepare comprehensive plans showing BMP selection, sizing calculations, maintenance requirements, and funding mechanisms. Los Angeles County's Enhanced Watershed Management Program requirements add complexity to WQMP preparation. Our [sustainable engineering design](/blog/sustainable-engineering-design-services) approach integrates water quality with landscape architecture.

**Drainage System Engineering**
Traditional drainage infrastructure includes storm drains, catch basins, area drains, and conveyance pipes. Hermosa Beach's flat topography and high groundwater require careful hydraulic design. We utilize advanced modeling software to ensure adequate capacity for the design storm event while preventing flooding.

**NPDES Compliance Support**
Construction projects disturbing over one acre require Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPPs). We prepare SWPPPs, conduct QSD/QSP services, and provide construction phase compliance support. Post-construction requirements necessitate permanent BMP design meeting numeric effluent limitations.

## How Does the Stormwater Design Process Work?

The stormwater engineering process typically takes 3-6 weeks from initial assessment to permit-ready plans. The process includes site analysis, conceptual design, detailed engineering, regulatory documentation, and permit coordination. Licensed Professional Engineers ensure compliance with local, regional, and state stormwater requirements.

**Phase 1: Site Assessment (1 week)**

We evaluate existing drainage patterns, soil infiltration rates, groundwater levels, and downstream conveyance capacity. Hermosa Beach's coastal location requires special attention to tidal influence and beach sand migration affecting outfall functionality.

**Phase 2: Conceptual Design (1-2 weeks)**

Conceptual design establishes BMP types, locations, and preliminary sizing. We balance water quality objectives with site constraints, construction costs, and maintenance requirements. Multiple alternatives often explore different LID strategies achieving the same treatment goals.

**Phase 3: Detailed Engineering (2-3 weeks)**

Detailed calculations size all stormwater components using approved methodologies. We prepare construction drawings showing grading, drainage infrastructure, BMP details, and erosion control measures. Specifications address materials, installation procedures, and performance standards.

**Phase 4: Regulatory Approval (Timeline varies)**

Hermosa Beach Public Works and Los Angeles County Flood Control District review drainage plans. We respond to comments, attend meetings, and coordinate approvals. Projects may require additional Regional Board or Coastal Commission review.

## What Are Regional Stormwater Considerations?

Stormwater requirements vary throughout Southern California based on watershed location, receiving water quality, and local regulations. Hermosa Beach's location in the Santa Monica Bay watershed with direct ocean discharge creates stringent water quality requirements exceeding many inland areas.

**Hermosa Beach & Coastal Communities**
Beach cities face unique challenges including bacteria TMDLs, trash reduction requirements, and heightened public scrutiny of ocean water quality. Limited pervious area and high land values favor compact, high-performance BMPs. Salt spray and corrosive conditions affect BMP material selection. Beach sand infiltration into storm drains requires specialized inlet protection.

**Los Angeles Basin Tributaries**
Communities like Torrance and El Segundo draining to Dominguez Channel face different pollutants of concern including metals and toxics from industrial legacy. Flood control requirements may supersede water quality in some areas. Regional detention basins and green streets programs offer compliance alternatives.

**Watershed-Based Requirements**
The Beach Cities Enhanced Watershed Management Program establishes specific reduction targets for bacteria, metals, and trash. Coordinated implementation allows cost-sharing for regional projects. Hermosa Beach's Greenbelt infiltration project demonstrates watershed-scale thinking.

## How Much Does Stormwater Design Cost?
