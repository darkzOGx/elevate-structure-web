### 2. Provide Complete Information Upfront

### 5. Get It Right the First Time

**Costly Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Scope creep (adding services mid-project)

A calculation letter for simple projects (single beam, header) is typically the most affordable option, starting around $350-$500.

**Can I do structural work without an engineer?**
Not legally for most projects in California. Building departments require PE-stamped plans for structural modifications.

**Why do prices vary so much between engineers?**
Differences in scope, experience, overhead, and approach. Always compare equivalent scopes when evaluating prices.

**Is it worth getting multiple quotes?**
Yes, for larger projects. For simple calculations, the time investment may not justify savings. We provide competitive quotes on first contact.
