Septic design engineering provides essential wastewater management solutions for properties throughout Redondo Beach, Torrance, Palos Verdes, and areas of Los Angeles County without sewer connections. Our licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with over 20 years of experience specialize in onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) design, alternative septic systems, and regulatory compliance with California's strict environmental standards. Understanding septic engineering requirements is crucial for property owners in unsewered areas or those seeking sustainable wastewater alternatives.

While most of Redondo Beach connects to municipal sewer systems, properties in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Rolling Hills, and canyon areas still rely on septic systems, with median property values exceeding $1.1 million requiring sophisticated engineering solutions. The region's varying soil conditions, environmental sensitivity, and strict Regional Water Quality Control Board regulations demand specialized expertise in advanced treatment systems.

## What is Septic Design Engineering?

Septic design engineering encompasses the evaluation, planning, and design of onsite wastewater treatment systems that safely process and dispose of domestic wastewater. In California, licensed Professional Engineers perform soil analysis, percolation testing, system sizing calculations, and prepare detailed plans showing septic tanks, distribution systems, leach fields, and alternative treatment units required for permit approval from local health departments and Regional Water Quality Control Boards.

These systems must effectively treat wastewater to protect groundwater, surface water, and public health while meeting increasingly stringent discharge standards. Every component—from septic tanks to dispersal fields—requires precise engineering based on site-specific conditions. Our [civil engineering services](/services/civil-engineering) team integrates septic design with overall site development planning.

The complexity increases in Southern California's diverse geology, where clay soils, bedrock, high groundwater, and steep slopes challenge conventional septic approaches. Properties near environmentally sensitive areas or water bodies require advanced treatment systems exceeding standard septic performance.

Comprehensive site assessment determines septic feasibility and optimal system location. We conduct percolation tests, soil profiles, groundwater monitoring, and slope stability analysis. Los Angeles County Environmental Health requires extensive testing for new systems. Properties in the Palos Verdes area often encounter challenging bedrock and clay conditions requiring detailed investigation.

**Conventional Septic System Design**
Standard septic systems utilizing septic tanks and gravity-fed leach fields work in areas with suitable soil conditions. We size components based on bedroom count, fixture units, and projected wastewater flows. Design considers setbacks from structures, property lines, wells, and water bodies. Our [engineering design services](/services/engineering-design) ensure code-compliant, efficient systems.

**Alternative Treatment Systems**
Advanced treatment units provide enhanced wastewater treatment where conventional systems won't work. We design aerobic treatment units (ATUs), membrane bioreactors, constructed wetlands, and sand filters. Pressure distribution and drip dispersal systems overcome site limitations. These systems meet strict nitrogen reduction requirements near sensitive water bodies.

**System Repairs and Upgrades**
Failing septic systems require immediate attention to prevent environmental contamination. We assess existing systems, identify failure causes, and design appropriate repairs or replacements. Upgrades often incorporate advanced treatment to meet current standards. Los Angeles County's Local Agency Management Program (LAMP) governs repair requirements.

## How Does the Septic Design Process Work?

The septic engineering process typically takes 4-8 weeks from initial site evaluation to permit-ready plans. The process includes feasibility assessment, testing and analysis, system design, regulatory documentation, and permit coordination. Licensed Professional Engineers ensure compliance with state and local regulations while optimizing system performance.

**Phase 1: Feasibility Study (1-2 weeks)**

Initial assessment evaluates site suitability for onsite wastewater treatment. We review property surveys, assess topography, identify constraints, and determine preliminary system locations. Redondo Beach area properties often require extensive investigation due to variable soil conditions.

**Phase 2: Testing and Analysis (2-3 weeks)**

Percolation tests measure soil absorption rates at proposed dispersal areas. Deep soil evaluations identify limiting layers, groundwater depth, and soil characteristics. We may conduct wet season groundwater monitoring for critical sites. Testing must occur during appropriate seasonal conditions per county requirements.

**Phase 3: System Design (1-2 weeks)**

Based on test results, we engineer appropriate treatment and dispersal systems. Calculations size all components using state and county methodologies. Construction drawings detail tank placement, piping layouts, dispersal field configuration, and electrical/control systems for advanced units.

**Phase 4: Permit Processing (2-4 weeks)**

Los Angeles County Environmental Health reviews septic plans for compliance with LAMP requirements. We respond to plan check comments and coordinate approvals. Complex systems may require Regional Board review. Coastal properties might need Coastal Commission permits.
