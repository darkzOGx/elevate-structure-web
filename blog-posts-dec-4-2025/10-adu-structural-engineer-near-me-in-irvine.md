## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I find an ADU structural engineer near me in Irvine?

Look for California-licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with ADU project experience. Verify licenses at bpelsg.ca.gov. Ask for references from similar ADU projects and confirm familiarity with Irvine's building department. AAA Engineering has 200+ ADU projects—call (949) 981-4448.

### Do I need a structural engineer for an ADU in Irvine?

Yes. Irvine requires PE-stamped structural plans for ADU building permits, including garage conversions. While some simple conversions might theoretically qualify for prescriptive design, professional engineering ensures smooth permit approval and safe construction. The cost is minimal compared to permit delays or construction problems.

### How long does ADU permitting take in Irvine?

Irvine processes ADU permits efficiently—typically 4-8 weeks from complete submittal to permit issuance. Engineering takes 2-3 weeks before submittal. Total timeline from start to permit: 6-12 weeks. Construction then takes 3-6 months depending on ADU type.

### Can I build an ADU if I have an HOA in Irvine?

California law (AB 670) prohibits HOAs from banning ADUs entirely, but they can impose reasonable restrictions. Many Irvine HOAs have developed ADU guidelines. We have experience working within HOA requirements and can advise on compliant designs.

### What size ADU can I build in Irvine?

State law allows: detached ADUs up to 1,200 SF, attached ADUs up to 1,000 SF (or 50% of primary dwelling), and JADUs up to 500 SF within existing space. Irvine generally follows state law. Lot coverage and setback requirements may limit size on specific properties.

### How much does an ADU cost to build in Irvine?

Total construction costs range from $200-$400 per square foot in Irvine. Garage conversions: $150-$250/SF. Detached new construction: $250-$400/SF. A 500 SF garage conversion might cost $75,000-$125,000 total; a 1,000 SF detached ADU might cost $250,000-$400,000.
