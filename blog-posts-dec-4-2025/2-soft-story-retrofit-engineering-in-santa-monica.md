# Soft-Story Retrofit Engineering in Santa Monica: Mandatory Compliance Guide 2025

Soft-story retrofit engineering addresses Santa Monica's mandatory seismic compliance requirements for vulnerable apartment buildings. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with 20+ years of experience have completed 500+ soft-story retrofits throughout Los Angeles County, helping property owners meet deadlines while minimizing costs and tenant disruption.

Santa Monica's Seismic Retrofit Ordinance requires approximately 1,900 wood-frame buildings with soft-story conditions to be retrofitted. Non-compliance penalties can exceed $1,000 per day, and building owners face significant liability exposure in any seismic event. Understanding your obligations and acting promptly is essential.

## What Is Soft-Story Retrofit Engineering in Santa Monica?

**Direct Answer:** Soft-story retrofit engineering is the structural design process of strengthening buildings with weak ground floors—typically apartment buildings with tuck-under parking or large commercial openings. In Santa Monica, this involves installing steel moment frames, plywood shear walls, or other lateral force-resisting systems to prevent collapse during earthquakes. All designs require PE-stamped plans and city permit approval.

### Why Soft-Story Buildings Are Dangerous

Soft-story buildings have ground floors that are significantly weaker than upper floors due to:

- **Open Parking Areas**: Tuck-under parking with minimal walls
- **Large Storefronts**: Commercial spaces with extensive glazing
- **Missing Shear Walls**: Lack of lateral bracing at ground level

During earthquakes, the weak story collapses while upper floors remain relatively intact—a phenomenon that killed 16 people in the 1994 Northridge earthquake at the Northridge Meadows apartment complex.

### Santa Monica's Seismic Risk

Santa Monica sits near several active faults:

- **Santa Monica Fault**: Runs directly through the city
- **Hollywood Fault**: 8 miles east
- **Newport-Inglewood Fault**: 10 miles south

The USGS estimates a 60% probability of a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake in Southern California within the next 30 years.

## What Are the Santa Monica Soft-Story Retrofit Requirements?

**Direct Answer:** Santa Monica's mandatory retrofit ordinance applies to wood-frame buildings with 3+ stories OR 2 stories with 5+ units that have soft, weak, or open-front ground floors. Building owners must complete engineering evaluation, submit retrofit plans, obtain permits, and finish construction by city-mandated deadlines. Non-compliance results in escalating fines and potential building condemnation.

### Buildings Subject to the Ordinance

| Building Type | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Wood-frame, 3+ stories, soft ground floor | Mandatory retrofit |
| Wood-frame, 2 stories, 5+ units, soft ground floor | Mandatory retrofit |
| Buildings with tuck-under parking | Typically subject |
| Buildings with commercial ground floor | Typically subject |

### Compliance Timeline

**Critical Deadlines:**

1. **Screening Letter Response**: Within 90 days of city notification
2. **Engineering Evaluation**: Submit within timeframe specified in your notice
3. **Permit Application**: Per city schedule (varies by building tier)
4. **Construction Completion**: Typically 2-4 years from permit issuance

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Santa Monica actively tracks compliance and issues daily fines for missed deadlines. Property transfers may require compliance or escrow holdbacks.

## How Does the Soft-Story Retrofit Process Work in Santa Monica?

**Direct Answer:** The retrofit process takes 6-18 months from initial evaluation to final inspection. It includes engineering assessment, structural design, permit application, construction, and city inspection. Most retrofits can be completed with tenants in place, though temporary parking displacement is common. Total costs range from $50,000-$250,000+ depending on building size.

### Phase 1: Engineering Evaluation (2-4 weeks)

**What's Involved:**
- Site visit and building documentation
- Review of original construction documents (if available)
- Structural analysis of existing conditions
- Determination of required strengthening
- Preliminary cost estimate

**Santa Monica Requirements:**
- Evaluation must be performed by California-licensed SE or PE
- Report follows ASCE 41 standards
- Submit to Building & Safety Division

### Phase 2: Structural Design (4-8 weeks)

**Key Deliverables:**
- PE-stamped structural calculations
- Construction drawings (plans, sections, details)
- Steel moment frame or shear wall designs
- Foundation upgrades (if required)
- Connection details

**Design Approaches:**

| Method | Cost | Disruption | Best For |
|--------|------|------------|----------|
| Steel Moment Frames | $$$ | Medium | Open parking retention |
| Plywood Shear Walls | $$ | Low | Lower-cost solution |
| Steel Brace Frames | $$$ | Medium | Narrow openings |
| Cantilevered Columns | $$$$ | High | Maximum openness |

### Phase 3: Permit and Construction (3-12 months)

**Permit Process:**
- Plan check: 4-8 weeks
- Permit issuance: Upon approval
- Construction: 8-16 weeks typical

**Construction Considerations:**
- Most work occurs at ground level
- Tenants typically remain during construction
- Parking may be temporarily reduced
- Noise ordinance compliance required

## What Are Common Soft-Story Retrofit Challenges in Santa Monica?

**Direct Answer:** Common challenges include preserving parking capacity, minimizing tenant disruption, meeting tight deadlines, working with historic buildings, and controlling costs. Santa Monica's dense urban environment and strict building codes require experienced engineers who understand local requirements and contractor capabilities.

### Challenge 1: Parking Preservation

**Problem:** Steel moment frames take space but property owners want to maintain parking count.

**Santa Monica Context:** Parking is already scarce; losing spaces affects property value and tenant satisfaction.

**Solution:** Cantilevered column designs or strategic frame placement can often preserve 80-100% of parking. Our designs prioritize functionality alongside structural requirements.

### Challenge 2: Historic Building Constraints

**Problem:** Santa Monica has many 1920s-1960s apartment buildings with architectural significance.

**Solution:** Concealed retrofit approaches, sympathetic detailing, and coordination with the Landmarks Commission when required. [Learn about historic building retrofits](/blog/historic-home-seismic-retrofit).

### Challenge 3: Tight Compliance Deadlines

**Problem:** Building owners often delay until deadlines loom, creating urgency.

**Solution:** Our streamlined process can achieve permit-ready drawings in 4-6 weeks for typical buildings. We maintain relationships with Santa Monica plan checkers for efficient review.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I miss the Santa Monica soft-story retrofit deadline?

The city issues daily fines starting at $250-$1,000 per day, escalating over time. Continued non-compliance can result in building condemnation, prohibition on collecting rent, and personal liability for owners in any earthquake. Properties become difficult to sell or refinance without compliance.

### Can I pass retrofit costs to my Santa Monica tenants?

Santa Monica's rent control ordinance allows landlords to pass through certain capital improvement costs to tenants over time, subject to limitations. Consult with a local attorney familiar with Santa Monica's Rent Control Board rules for specific guidance.

### How long does soft-story construction take?

Typical construction takes 8-16 weeks depending on building size and retrofit complexity. Most work occurs during business hours at ground level. Tenants can usually remain in their units, though parking access may be temporarily limited.

### Do I need to relocate tenants during retrofit construction?

Generally no. Most soft-story retrofits affect only the ground floor/parking level. Upper-floor tenants may experience noise and some inconvenience but rarely need to relocate. Ground-floor commercial tenants may need temporary modifications.

### What's the difference between steel moment frames and shear walls?

Steel moment frames are rigid frames that resist lateral forces through beam-column connections, leaving openings clear. Plywood shear walls are solid panels that resist forces but block openings. Frames cost more but preserve parking; walls cost less but reduce open space.

### Is my building definitely subject to the ordinance?

If you received a screening letter from Santa Monica, your building is on the mandatory compliance list. If you haven't received notice but own a wood-frame building with 3+ stories or 2 stories with 5+ units that has open ground-floor parking, contact the Building & Safety Division to verify status.
