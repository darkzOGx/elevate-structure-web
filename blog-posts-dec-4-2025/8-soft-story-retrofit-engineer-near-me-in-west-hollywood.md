## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I find a soft-story retrofit engineer near me in West Hollywood?

Look for California-licensed Professional Engineers (PE) with specific soft-story retrofit experience in West Hollywood or Los Angeles County. Verify licenses at bpelsg.ca.gov. Ask for references from similar projects and confirm familiarity with West Hollywood's ordinance. AAA Engineering has 300+ soft-story retrofits—call (949) 981-4448.

### What happens if I miss West Hollywood's soft-story deadline?

The city issues daily fines starting at $250-$1,000 per day, escalating over time. Continued non-compliance can result in building condemnation, prohibition on collecting rent, and personal liability for owners in any earthquake. Properties become difficult to sell or refinance without compliance.

### Can I pass retrofit costs to my West Hollywood tenants?

West Hollywood's rent stabilization ordinance allows capital improvement cost pass-through to tenants under specific rules. The Rent Stabilization Division reviews applications. Consult with a local attorney familiar with WeHo rent regulations for specific guidance on your situation.

### How long does West Hollywood soft-story retrofit take?

From evaluation to final inspection: 3-8 months typical. Engineering evaluation: 1-2 weeks. Design: 3-6 weeks. Permitting: 2-4 weeks. Construction: 6-12 weeks. Starting early ensures comfortable deadline compliance and contractor availability.

### Do tenants need to relocate during retrofit construction?

Generally no. Most soft-story work affects only the ground floor/parking level. Upper-floor tenants may experience some noise and temporary parking inconvenience but rarely need to relocate. Ground-floor commercial tenants may need temporary modifications.
