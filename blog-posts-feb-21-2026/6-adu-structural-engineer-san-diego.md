San Diego leads California in ADU construction, with thousands of permits issued annually. Every ADU project in San Diego requires structural engineering from a licensed Professional Engineer to obtain a building permit. Whether you are building a detached ADU, converting a garage, or adding a junior ADU (JADU), this guide explains what your San Diego ADU structural engineer does, what it costs, and how to choose the right firm.

## Why You Need an ADU Structural Engineer in San Diego

The City of San Diego Development Services Department requires PE-stamped structural calculations and construction drawings for all ADU building permits. This requirement exists because ADUs are permanent habitable structures that must:

- **Resist seismic forces** — San Diego sits in Seismic Design Category D, requiring complete lateral force-resisting system design for every ADU
- **Support gravity loads** — Floor, wall, and roof systems must carry code-prescribed dead and live loads safely
- **Transfer loads to foundations** — Foundation systems must be designed for site-specific soil conditions in San Diego
- **Meet fire separation requirements** — ADUs near property lines or existing structures need fire-rated construction with engineered connections
- **Comply with CBC 2022** — California Building Code requirements apply to all ADU construction in San Diego

An ADU structural engineer in San Diego designs all load-carrying elements of your accessory dwelling unit and produces the permit documents your contractor needs to build safely and legally.

## ADU Types and Structural Engineering Requirements in San Diego

### Detached ADU Structural Engineering

A detached ADU in San Diego is a standalone structure built on your property. Structural engineering requirements include:

**Foundation Design** — San Diego soil conditions vary from stable decomposed granite in the eastern neighborhoods to expansive clay in coastal and valley areas. Your ADU structural engineer designs foundations matched to your site's geotechnical conditions:
- Standard continuous footings (16" to 24" wide, 12" to 18" deep minimum)
- Post-tensioned slab-on-grade for expansive soils
- Raised foundation with stem walls for sloping sites
- Deepened footings near property lines per San Diego setback requirements

**Floor Framing** — Raised floor ADUs in San Diego need engineered floor joist systems. Slab-on-grade ADUs require properly reinforced concrete with moisture barriers and insulation per Title 24.

**Wall Framing** — Standard 2x4 or 2x6 wood stud walls with engineered headers, posts, and connections. The ADU structural engineer in San Diego specifies:
- Stud size, spacing, and grade
- Header sizes for all door and window openings
- Hold-down anchor locations and capacities
- Shear wall locations, nailing patterns, and anchorage

**Roof Framing** — Conventional or engineered roof trusses, rafters, ridge beams, and hip/valley framing. Roof design accounts for dead loads, live loads, and wind uplift forces specific to San Diego conditions.

**Lateral System** — The seismic force-resisting system is the most critical structural element. Your San Diego ADU structural engineer designs shear walls, anchor bolts, hold-downs, and diaphragm connections to resist earthquake forces throughout the structure.

### Garage Conversion ADU in San Diego

Garage conversions represent the most popular ADU type in San Diego due to lower construction costs and existing structural framework. ADU structural engineering for San Diego garage conversions addresses:

**Existing Structure Evaluation** — A [structural inspection](/services/structural-inspection) assesses the garage's current condition:
- Foundation adequacy for habitable space requirements
- Slab thickness and reinforcement (typical garage slabs are 3.5" to 4" — often inadequate)
- Wall framing condition and capacity
- Roof structure adequacy for insulation and ceiling loads
- Existing lateral system evaluation

**Floor Upgrades** — Most San Diego garage slabs need modification for ADU conversion:
- Concrete overlay to achieve minimum 4" thickness with reinforcement
- Moisture barrier installation between slab and finish floor
- Floor leveling for proper drainage and accessibility

**Wall Modifications** — Converting a garage opening to a wall requires structural engineering:
- New wall framing at the former garage door opening with proper foundation
- Window and door opening headers
- Shear wall design to replace lateral capacity of any removed walls
- Fire-rated construction where required by proximity to property lines

**Seismic Upgrades** — Older San Diego garages often lack adequate seismic connections. The ADU structural engineer designs:
- Foundation anchor bolts (sill plate-to-foundation connections)
- Cripple wall bracing (if raised foundation exists)
- Roof-to-wall connections (hurricane ties)
- Shear wall nailing and hold-down upgrades

### Junior ADU (JADU) in San Diego

JADUs in San Diego are limited to 500 square feet within the existing primary residence. Structural engineering for San Diego JADUs includes:

- Interior wall modifications (new openings or wall removals)
- [Load-bearing wall removal](/services/load-bearing-wall-removal) engineering when creating open layouts
- Kitchen equipment support (appliance loads, plumbing penetrations)
- Fire separation walls between JADU and primary dwelling
- Exterior door framing for required separate entrance

### Two-Story ADU in San Diego

San Diego allows two-story ADUs up to 16 feet in height. These structures require more extensive structural engineering:

- Two-story lateral system design with increased seismic forces
- Second-floor framing for heavier loads
- Stacking analysis for load path continuity
- Increased foundation demands from higher gravity and lateral loads
- Stairway framing and connections

## San Diego ADU Structural Engineering Process

### Step 1: Site Evaluation

Your ADU structural engineer visits the San Diego property to assess:
- Existing structures and setback constraints
- Grade conditions and drainage patterns
- Access for construction equipment
- Utility locations and connection points
- Soil surface conditions (pending geotechnical report)

### Step 2: Structural Design

Based on architectural plans and site conditions, the San Diego ADU structural engineer designs:
- Complete foundation system
- Floor framing (if applicable)
- Wall framing with all headers, posts, and connections
- Roof framing system
- Lateral force-resisting system (shear walls, diaphragms, collectors)
- Connection hardware specifications

### Step 3: Plan Preparation

The engineer prepares construction documents including:
- Foundation plan
- Floor framing plan
- Roof framing plan
- Structural details and sections
- Connection schedules
- Structural notes and specifications
- Stamped structural calculations

### Step 4: Permit Support

AAA Engineering & Design submits plans to the San Diego Development Services Department and responds to plan check comments. San Diego ADU plan check typically takes 2 to 4 weeks for residential projects with a streamlined ADU review process.

### Step 5: Construction Observation

During construction, your San Diego ADU structural engineer provides:
- Foundation inspection before concrete placement
- Framing inspection before wall close-up
- Special inspection coordination (if required)
- Response to contractor questions about structural details
- [Foundation inspection](/services/foundation-inspection) services during construction

## San Diego ADU Regulations Affecting Structural Engineering

### Size Limits

San Diego permits ADUs up to 1,200 square feet for properties with an existing single-family home. The maximum height for detached ADUs is 16 feet. These limits define the structural engineering scope — larger ADUs require more comprehensive structural systems.

### Setback Requirements

San Diego allows ADUs with 4-foot rear and side yard setbacks (reduced from standard zoning). ADUs within 5 feet of property lines require 1-hour fire-rated exterior walls, which affects structural wall design and material specifications.

### Foundation Requirements

San Diego requires engineered foundations for all ADUs. Garage conversions must demonstrate that existing foundations meet CBC requirements or provide foundation upgrades designed by a licensed PE. New ADU foundations follow standard CBC requirements with San Diego-specific soil considerations.

### Accessory Structures

San Diego allows conversion of existing accessory structures (workshops, sheds, pool houses) to ADUs. Structural engineering evaluates the existing structure and designs modifications to meet habitable space requirements.

## Common ADU Structural Engineering Questions in San Diego

### Soil Conditions Across San Diego

San Diego soil conditions significantly impact ADU [foundation engineering](/services/foundation-engineering):

- **Coastal neighborhoods** (Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, Point Loma) — Sandy soils with moderate bearing capacity, potential for liquefaction near the coast
- **Central San Diego** (North Park, Hillcrest, University Heights) — Variable conditions from decomposed granite to clay soils
- **Eastern San Diego** (La Mesa, El Cajon, Santee) — Generally favorable decomposed granite soils with good bearing capacity
- **South San Diego** (Chula Vista, National City) — Bay fill areas with compressible soils requiring deeper foundations

A geotechnical report determines site-specific soil parameters for ADU foundation design in San Diego. Most residential lots require a $1,500 to $3,000 soils investigation.
