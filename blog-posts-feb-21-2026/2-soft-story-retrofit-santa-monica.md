# Soft Story Retrofit Deadline in Santa Monica: 2026 Compliance Guide

<div data-speakable>
Santa Monica's soft story retrofit program requires multi-unit residential buildings with ground-floor parking or commercial space to complete seismic upgrades. Building owners who miss compliance deadlines face escalating fines starting at $500 per day. AAA Engineering & Design provides licensed PE retrofit engineering for Santa Monica properties.
</div>

The soft story retrofit deadline in Santa Monica represents one of the most aggressive mandatory seismic upgrade programs in Southern California. Building owners must understand their obligations, timelines, and engineering requirements to avoid penalties and protect tenants. This 2026 compliance guide covers every aspect of Santa Monica's soft story retrofit program.

## What Is a Soft Story Building in Santa Monica?

A soft story building has a ground floor that is significantly weaker or more flexible than the floors above it. In Santa Monica, this condition commonly appears in multi-unit apartment buildings constructed before 1978 where the ground floor features:

- **Tuck-under parking** — Open parking areas beneath residential units create large wall openings that reduce lateral resistance
- **Ground-floor commercial space** — Storefronts with large windows and open floor plans weaken the building's base
- **Minimal ground-floor walls** — Buildings with fewer shear walls on the first floor than upper floors

Santa Monica's building inventory contains hundreds of these vulnerable structures. The 1994 Northridge Earthquake demonstrated the catastrophic failure mode: upper floors pancake onto the weak ground floor, causing total building collapse and loss of life.

## Santa Monica Soft Story Retrofit Timeline

Santa Monica enacted its Mandatory Seismic Retrofit Ordinance to address the inventory of vulnerable soft story buildings throughout the city. The program established a phased compliance schedule based on building characteristics.

### Compliance Phases for Santa Monica

**Priority Buildings (16+ Units)**
Larger apartment buildings in Santa Monica with 16 or more dwelling units faced the earliest compliance deadlines. These buildings house the most residents and present the greatest life-safety risk during a major earthquake.

**Standard Buildings (3-15 Units)**
Mid-size multi-family buildings in Santa Monica with 3 to 15 units follow the standard compliance timeline. This category represents the largest number of affected buildings in the Santa Monica retrofit program.

**All Remaining Buildings**
Any remaining soft story structures in Santa Monica that did not fall into earlier priority categories must comply under the final phase of the program.

### Current Status in 2026

As of February 2026, Santa Monica has completed notification of all affected building owners. Property owners who have not yet begun the retrofit process face increasing enforcement pressure. The City of Santa Monica Building and Safety Division actively monitors compliance and issues violation notices for non-compliant properties.

Building owners in Santa Monica who have received a Notice of Non-Compliance must submit retrofit plans within the specified timeframe or face daily fines. The city does not grant extensions without documented engineering justification and an approved timeline.

## Soft Story Retrofit Requirements in Santa Monica

### Engineering Standards

Santa Monica requires soft story retrofits to meet the standards established in ASCE 41-17 (Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings) as adopted by the California Existing Building Code. Key requirements include:

**Performance Objective** — Buildings must achieve the Basic Performance Objective for Existing Buildings (BPOE), which targets Life Safety performance under the BSE-1E seismic hazard level.

**Analysis Method** — Engineers use linear or nonlinear analysis methods depending on building characteristics. Most Santa Monica soft story retrofits use the linear static procedure for Type 1 buildings (wood-frame construction with tuck-under parking).

**Foundation Evaluation** — Existing foundations must be evaluated for the increased loads introduced by the retrofit. Santa Monica requires [foundation engineering](/services/foundation-engineering) analysis to confirm adequate capacity or design foundation strengthening.

### Typical Retrofit Scope for Santa Monica Buildings

A soft story retrofit in Santa Monica typically involves:

1. **Steel moment frames** — Installed at ground-floor openings to provide lateral resistance while maintaining parking access
2. **Plywood shear walls** — Added to ground-floor walls where existing framing allows
3. **Hold-down anchors** — Simpson Strong-Tie HD or equivalent anchors resist overturning forces
4. **Foundation upgrades** — New concrete footings beneath moment frame columns transfer lateral loads to the soil
5. **Drag struts and collectors** — Transfer lateral forces from upper floors to new ground-floor lateral elements
6. **Connection hardware** — Metal connectors tie the retrofit system to existing wood framing

### Santa Monica Plan Check Requirements

Santa Monica Building and Safety requires the following for soft story retrofit plan submission:

- Structural calculations stamped by a California-licensed PE or SE
- Retrofit construction drawings showing all new structural elements
- Connection details for retrofit-to-existing-structure interfaces
- Foundation plans showing new footings and reinforcement
- Shoring and construction sequence plans
- Special inspection requirements and testing protocols

Plan check review in Santa Monica typically takes 4 to 8 weeks for soft story retrofit projects. Incomplete submissions or submissions requiring significant corrections extend this timeline.

## Soft Story Retrofit Cost in Santa Monica

### Engineering Fees

Structural engineering for a soft story retrofit in Santa Monica costs $3,500 to $8,000 depending on building size and complexity. This fee includes:

- Existing building evaluation and field investigation
- Structural analysis and design calculations
- Construction drawings (typically 5 to 12 sheets)
- Plan check response and corrections
- Construction observation during retrofit installation

AAA Engineering & Design provides competitive engineering fees for Santa Monica soft story retrofits with transparent pricing and no hidden costs.

### Construction Costs

Soft story retrofit construction in Santa Monica ranges from $60,000 to $200,000+ depending on:

| Building Size | Typical Construction Cost | Cost Per Unit |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| 3–8 units | $60,000–$100,000 | $8,000–$15,000 |
| 9–15 units | $80,000–$150,000 | $7,000–$12,000 |
| 16+ units | $120,000–$200,000+ | $6,000–$10,000 |

Per-unit costs decrease for larger buildings because fixed costs (mobilization, steel fabrication, foundation work) spread across more units. Santa Monica contractors experienced with soft story retrofits complete most projects in 8 to 16 weeks.

### Cost Recovery Options for Santa Monica Building Owners

Santa Monica's rent control ordinance includes provisions for retrofit cost recovery through capital improvement rent increases. Building owners can petition the Santa Monica Rent Control Board for:

- **Capital improvement surcharge** — Pass-through of approved retrofit costs to tenants over a defined period
- **Seismic retrofit surcharge** — Specific provisions for seismic upgrade cost recovery

The Rent Control Board reviews each petition individually. Documentation of engineering costs, construction costs, and permits strengthens the application. Building owners should consult with their property management attorney regarding the current cost recovery provisions available in Santa Monica.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance in Santa Monica

### Financial Penalties

Santa Monica enforces soft story retrofit compliance through escalating penalties:

- **Initial violation notice** — Formal notification with compliance deadline
- **Daily fines** — Starting at $500 per day for continued non-compliance
- **Administrative citations** — Additional penalties layered on top of daily fines
- **Lien on property** — Accumulated fines recorded as a lien against the property in Santa Monica

### Operational Consequences

Beyond financial penalties, non-compliant soft story buildings in Santa Monica face:

- **Certificate of Occupancy issues** — The city may restrict or revoke occupancy for non-compliant buildings
- **Insurance complications** — Carriers increasingly require seismic retrofit documentation for policy renewal
- **Sale impediments** — Buyers and lenders identify non-compliant buildings during due diligence, reducing property value or blocking transactions
- **Tenant liability** — Building owners bear enhanced liability for tenant injuries during an earthquake if the building was identified as requiring retrofit and the owner failed to comply

## The Soft Story Retrofit Engineering Process

### Phase 1: Building Evaluation

The engineering process for a Santa Monica soft story retrofit begins with a thorough evaluation of the existing building.

**Field Investigation** — Your structural engineer visits the Santa Monica property to document:
- Existing structural framing (floor joists, wall studs, headers, posts)
- Foundation type and condition
- Ground-floor wall layout and opening locations
- Upper-floor framing and lateral system
- Building dimensions and floor-to-floor heights

**Document Review** — The engineer reviews available building plans, soils reports, and previous engineering assessments. For older Santa Monica buildings, original plans may not exist, requiring more extensive field investigation.

**[Structural Inspection](/services/structural-inspection)** — A thorough inspection identifies existing deficiencies beyond the soft story condition, including deteriorated framing, inadequate connections, and foundation problems that must be addressed during the retrofit.

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis and Design

**Demand Analysis** — The engineer calculates seismic forces on the Santa Monica building using site-specific seismic hazard data, soil classification, and building dynamic characteristics.

**Capacity Evaluation** — Existing structural elements are evaluated against seismic demands. The analysis identifies specific deficiencies: inadequate shear capacity, insufficient overturning resistance, weak diaphragm connections, and foundation shortcomings.

**Retrofit Design** — The engineer designs new structural elements to address identified deficiencies. For Santa Monica soft story buildings, this typically means steel moment frames at parking openings, supplemental shear walls, and foundation upgrades.

**Cost Optimization** — An experienced structural engineer minimizes retrofit construction cost while meeting all code requirements. Frame locations, sizes, and connection details directly affect construction cost. AAA Engineering & Design optimizes every Santa Monica soft story retrofit design for cost-effectiveness.

### Phase 3: Plan Preparation and Permitting

**Construction Documents** — The engineer prepares detailed structural drawings and specifications for the Santa Monica Building and Safety Department. Plans include:
- Retrofit framing plans
- Foundation plans
- Structural details and sections
- Connection schedules
- Special inspection requirements
- General and structural notes

**Plan Submission** — Complete plans with stamped calculations are submitted to Santa Monica for review. Your structural engineer coordinates with the plan checker to resolve any comments efficiently.

**Permit Issuance** — Once Santa Monica Building and Safety approves the plans, a building permit is issued. Construction can begin immediately upon permit issuance.

### Phase 4: Construction Support

**Pre-Construction Meeting** — The structural engineer reviews retrofit plans with the contractor to clarify construction sequence, critical connections, and quality requirements for the Santa Monica project.

**Construction Observation** — During construction, the engineer conducts periodic site visits to verify the contractor installs retrofit elements according to the plans. Critical observations include:
- Steel moment frame erection and connection welding
- Hold-down anchor installation
- Foundation reinforcement and concrete placement
- Shear wall nailing and anchorage
- Drag strut and collector installation

**Special Inspections** — Santa Monica requires special inspections for structural steel welding, high-strength bolting, and concrete placement. The structural engineer specifies inspection requirements and reviews inspection reports.

## Common Soft Story Retrofit Challenges in Santa Monica

### Parking Access Preservation

Building owners in Santa Monica need to maintain parking functionality during and after the retrofit. Steel moment frames are designed to span parking stall openings without reducing the number of available spaces. Frame column locations must coordinate with parking layout geometry.

### Tenant Coordination

Santa Monica's strong tenant protections require careful coordination during retrofit construction. Building owners must provide adequate notice to tenants, maintain habitable conditions during construction, and minimize disruption. Construction typically occurs at ground level, but noise, dust, and access restrictions affect upper-floor tenants.

### Utility Conflicts

Ground-floor utilities — gas lines, water mains, electrical panels, and sewer laterals — often conflict with new foundation elements and steel columns. The retrofit engineer coordinates with utility providers to relocate conflicting services in Santa Monica properties.

### Historic Building Considerations

Santa Monica has numerous historic properties subject to the soft story retrofit requirement. Historic buildings require retrofit designs that preserve character-defining features while achieving seismic performance objectives. The Santa Monica Landmarks Commission reviews retrofit plans for designated historic structures.
