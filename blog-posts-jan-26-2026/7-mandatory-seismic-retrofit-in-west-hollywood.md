# Mandatory Seismic Retrofit in West Hollywood: Compliance Deadline Guide 2026

**Quick Answer:** West Hollywood mandatory seismic retrofit engineering costs $15,000-$40,000 for PE-stamped plans, with total retrofit costs of $50,000-$200,000 depending on building size. AAA Engineering Design has completed 150+ soft-story retrofits throughout Los Angeles County with a 100% permit approval rate.

West Hollywood's mandatory seismic retrofit program protects the city's dense residential community from earthquake damage. If you own a building subject to this ordinance, you need experienced structural engineers who understand both the technical requirements and the unique characteristics of West Hollywood's building stock. Our PE-licensed team specializes in designing efficient, code-compliant retrofits that meet deadlines and minimize costs.

## Understanding West Hollywood's Seismic Retrofit Ordinance

West Hollywood identified over 800 potentially vulnerable buildings when establishing its mandatory retrofit program. Understanding the ordinance requirements is essential for affected property owners.

### Buildings Subject to the Ordinance

West Hollywood's seismic retrofit ordinance applies to buildings meeting these criteria:

**Building Characteristics:**
- Wood-frame construction
- Two or more stories
- Ground floor parking, commercial, or other open areas
- Built before January 1, 1978

**Soft-Story Indicators:**
- Tuck-under parking at ground level
- Large openings at ground floor
- Commercial storefronts below residential
- Minimal shear walls at ground level

### What Makes Buildings "Soft Story"?

Soft-story buildings have significantly weaker ground floors compared to floors above:

**Structural Vulnerability:**
- Open ground floors lack lateral resistance
- Upper floors are stiffer than ground floor
- Seismic forces concentrate at weak level
- Historical earthquake damage demonstrates risk

**Historical Context:**
- Northridge 1994: 16 deaths in soft-story collapses
- Significant property damage to soft-story buildings
- West Hollywood's building stock particularly vulnerable
- Led to mandatory retrofit programs regionwide

### Compliance Timeline

West Hollywood established phased deadlines based on building priority:

| Phase | Building Type | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Priority 1 | Largest buildings, highest risk | Deadlines passed |
| Priority 2 | Medium buildings | Current deadlines |
| Priority 3 | Smaller buildings | Upcoming deadlines |
| Priority 4 | Remaining buildings | Future deadlines |

**Check your compliance notice or contact the West Hollywood Building Division for your specific deadline.**

## West Hollywood Retrofit Design Approaches

### Steel Moment Frame Retrofit

The most common approach for West Hollywood soft-story buildings:

**System Description:**
- Steel frames installed at ground level
- Frames resist lateral seismic forces
- Maintains open parking and access
- Proven performance in earthquakes

**Design Elements:**
- Frame sizing per lateral analysis
- Connection details per AISC standards
- Foundation modifications as needed
- Collector elements for load distribution

**Advantages for West Hollywood:**
- Preserves parking spaces
- Minimizes tenant disruption
- Predictable costs and timeline
- City-approved standard approach

### Cantilever Column Retrofit

An alternative for specific building configurations:

**Design Approach:**
- Strengthen existing columns
- Add steel jackets or concrete encasement
- Improve foundation connections
- Increase column ductility

**Best Applications:**
- Buildings with suitable existing columns
- Where moment frames aren't practical
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Architectural constraint situations

### Plywood Shear Wall Retrofit

For buildings with suitable wall locations:

**System Components:**
- Structural plywood sheathing on existing walls
- Hold-down anchors at wall ends
- Foundation anchor bolts
- Collector connections at top

**Considerations:**
- Requires suitable wall locations
- May affect ground floor layout
- Lower cost in some situations
- Less common in dense West Hollywood
