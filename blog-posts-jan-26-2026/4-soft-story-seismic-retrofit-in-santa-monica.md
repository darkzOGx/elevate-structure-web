# Soft-Story Seismic Retrofit in Santa Monica: Compliance Guide 2026

**Quick Answer:** Santa Monica soft-story seismic retrofit engineering costs $15,000-$40,000 for PE-stamped plans, with total retrofit costs of $50,000-$200,000 depending on building size. AAA Engineering Design has completed 200+ soft-story retrofits throughout Los Angeles County with a 100% permit approval rate.

Santa Monica's mandatory soft-story retrofit program protects lives by strengthening vulnerable apartment buildings against earthquake damage. As a building owner affected by this ordinance, you need experienced structural engineers who understand both the technical requirements and the city's approval process. Our PE-licensed team specializes in designing efficient, code-compliant retrofits that meet deadlines and minimize costs.

## Understanding Santa Monica's Soft-Story Requirements

Santa Monica identified over 2,000 potentially vulnerable buildings when establishing its mandatory retrofit program. Understanding which buildings require retrofits and the compliance timeline is essential for affected property owners.

### Buildings Subject to the Ordinance

Santa Monica's soft-story retrofit ordinance applies to buildings meeting these criteria:

**Building Characteristics:**
- Wood-frame construction
- Three or more stories, OR two stories over parking/commercial
- Built before January 1, 1978
- Soft, weak, or open-front walls at ground level

**Soft-Story Indicators:**
- Ground floor parking (open or enclosed)
- Large commercial storefronts
- Minimal shear walls at ground level
- Tuck-under parking configurations

### What Makes a Building "Soft"?

Soft-story buildings have significantly less stiffness at ground level than floors above:

**Structural Vulnerability:**
- Large openings reduce lateral resistance
- Parking areas lack shear walls
- Upper floors are stiffer than ground floor
- Forces concentrate at weak level during earthquakes

**Historical Earthquake Damage:**
- Northridge 1994: Major soft-story collapses
- Loma Prieta 1989: Similar failures observed
- San Fernando 1971: Pattern first identified

### Compliance Timeline

Santa Monica established phased deadlines based on building priority:

| Phase | Building Type | Deadline Status |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Priority 1 | Largest buildings | Deadlines passed |
| Priority 2 | Medium buildings | Deadlines passed/current |
| Priority 3 | Smaller buildings | Current/upcoming |
| Priority 4 | Remaining buildings | Upcoming |

**Contact the Santa Monica Building Department to confirm your specific deadline.**

## Retrofit Design Options for Santa Monica Buildings

### Steel Moment Frame Retrofit

The most common retrofit approach for Santa Monica soft-story buildings:

**How It Works:**
- Steel frames installed at ground level
- Frames resist lateral earthquake forces
- Minimal impact on parking and access
- Proven performance in earthquakes

**Advantages:**
- Maintains open ground floor
- Relatively quick installation
- Predictable costs
- City-approved standard approach

**Typical Installation:**
- 4-8 steel frames per building
- Connections to existing structure
- Foundation upgrades as needed
- 2-4 month construction period

### Cantilever Column Retrofit

An alternative approach for certain building configurations:

**Design Concept:**
- Strengthen existing columns
- Add steel jackets or concrete encasement
- Improve foundation connections
- Increase column ductility

**Applications:**
- Buildings with specific geometries
- Where moment frames aren't practical
- Cost optimization opportunities

### Plywood Shear Wall Retrofit

For buildings with suitable wall locations:

**Approach:**
- Add structural plywood to existing walls
- Install hold-down anchors
- Upgrade foundation connections
- Maintain building appearance

**Considerations:**
- Requires suitable wall locations
- May affect parking layout
- Lower cost in some situations
- Less common in Santa Monica

## The Soft-Story Retrofit Engineering Process

### Phase 1: Building Assessment

Initial evaluation determines retrofit requirements:

**Document Review:**
- Original construction drawings (if available)
- Previous permits and modifications
- City records and ordinance status
- Tenant notification requirements

**Site Investigation:**
- Existing structural conditions
- Foundation type and condition
- Ground floor configuration
- Access and construction constraints

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis

Engineering analysis establishes design parameters:

**Analysis Methods:**
- ASCE 41-17 Tier 3 evaluation
- Linear or nonlinear analysis as appropriate
- Performance objectives per city requirements
- Foundation capacity assessment

**Design Parameters:**
- Required lateral strength
- Acceptable drift limits
- Foundation upgrade needs
- Connection requirements

### Phase 3: Retrofit Design

Complete design development produces construction documents:

**Design Deliverables:**
- Structural drawings (plans, elevations, details)
- Structural calculations
- Foundation design
- Connection details

**City Requirements:**
- Standard plan format compliance
- Calculation package requirements
- Special inspection requirements
- Contractor qualifications

### Phase 4: Permit and Construction Support

Engineering support through completion:

**Permitting:**
- Plan check submittal
- Response to corrections
- Permit issuance coordination

**Construction:**
- Pre-construction meeting
- Special inspection coordination
- Field observation visits
- Certificate of occupancy support
