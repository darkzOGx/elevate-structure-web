# Second Story Addition Engineering in Long Beach: Complete Guide 2026

**Quick Answer:** Second story addition engineering in Long Beach costs $8,000-$20,000 for PE-stamped structural plans depending on project scope. AAA Engineering Design has completed 200+ second story additions throughout Southern California with expertise in foundation evaluation and efficient structural design.

Long Beach homeowners increasingly look upward to expand their living space, adding bedrooms, offices, and master suites while preserving valuable yard area. Second story additions require careful structural engineering to ensure your existing home can safely support the new construction. Our PE-licensed engineers specialize in designing efficient second story additions that maximize your investment while maintaining structural integrity.

## Understanding Second Story Addition Requirements

### Why Engineering Matters

Adding a second story creates significant structural demands:

**Load Considerations:**
- Additional dead load (structure weight)
- Live loads (occupants, furniture)
- Roof loads transferred differently
- Lateral forces from wind and seismic

**Structural Chain Reaction:**
- New loads must travel to foundation
- Existing walls must carry increased loads
- Foundation must support total building
- Lateral system must resist larger forces

### Long Beach Building Requirements

The City of Long Beach has specific requirements for second story additions:

**Permit Requirements:**
- PE-stamped structural plans mandatory
- Architectural plans for design review
- Title 24 energy compliance
- CEQA compliance (usually exempt)

**Code Requirements:**
- California Building Code 2025
- Long Beach Municipal Code modifications
- Seismic design per ASCE 7-22
- Fire-resistive construction requirements

**Special Districts:**
- Coastal Zone: Coastal Development Permit may be required
- Historic Districts: Design review for compatibility
- Specific Plans: Height and setback limitations
- Flood Zones: Elevation requirements

## Structural Components of Second Story Additions

### Foundation Evaluation and Upgrades

The foundation is critical for second story success:

**Foundation Assessment:**
- Review original construction documents
- Physical inspection of existing foundation
- Load capacity analysis
- Condition evaluation for deficiencies

**Common Foundation Types in Long Beach:**
- Raised foundations with crawl spaces (older homes)
- Slab-on-grade (post-1960 construction)
- Post-tension slabs (newer construction)
- Combination systems

**Upgrade Options:**
- Sister footings alongside existing
- Foundation underpinning
- Epoxy doweling for capacity
- Complete foundation replacement (rare)

### Existing Wall Evaluation

Walls must transfer new loads to foundation:

**Wall Assessment:**
- Stud size and spacing verification
- Header sizes at openings
- Bearing wall identification
- Connection to foundation

**Wall Modifications:**
- Add studs for increased loads
- Upgrade headers at openings
- Install posts for point loads
- Strengthen wall-to-foundation connections

### New Second Floor Framing

Design of the new floor and walls:

**Floor System Options:**
- Conventional joists (2x10, 2x12)
- Engineered joists (I-joists, trusses)
- Steel beams for long spans
- Combination systems

**Second Floor Walls:**
- Load-bearing wall layout
- Shear wall locations for lateral loads
- Header design for openings
- Top plate connections

### Roof Structure

The new roof completes the structural system:

**Roof Framing:**
