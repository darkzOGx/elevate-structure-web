- Uneven or sloping floors
- Gaps between walls and ceiling

**Exterior Indicators:**
- Cracks in exterior stucco
- Separation at siding joints
- Chimney leaning or cracked
- Concrete patio pulling away
- Soil pulling away from foundation

**When to Call an Engineer:**
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch
- Cracks with displacement (offset)
- Multiple cracks in pattern
- Progressive cracking (getting worse)
- After earthquake or flood

## Types of Foundation Problems

### Foundation Settlement

When foundations sink or move:

**Causes of Settlement:**
- Soil consolidation under weight
- Expansive clay soil shrinkage
- Drainage issues washing out soil
- Poor compaction during construction

- Diagonal wall cracks
- Doors out of square
- Cracks wider at top or bottom
- Separation at joints

### Foundation Cracking

Understanding different crack types:

**Crack Categories:**

- Structural cracks (concerning)
- Shrinkage cracks (common)
- Settlement cracks (serious)
- Earthquake damage (variable)

**Concerning Crack Patterns:**
- Diagonal cracks at corners
- Horizontal cracks (pressure)
- Stair-step cracks in block
- Cracks with displacement
- Widening over time

### Foundation Heave

When foundations lift:

**Causes of Heave:**
- Expansive clay soil swelling
- Frost heave (rare in SoCal)
- Tree root growth
- Plumbing leak saturation
- Improper drainage

**Heave Indicators:**
- Floors humping upward
- Doors binding at top
- Cracks wider at bottom
- Concrete lifting
- Interior grade higher than perimeter

## Foundation Repair Engineering Services

- Hand-dug segments
- Supports existing foundation
- Transfers loads to deeper soil
- Permanent solution

**When Used:**
- Shallow foundations needing depth
- Settlement from poor soil
- Adding basement or crawl space
- Adjacent excavation support

### Pier Systems

Modern solutions for settlement:

**Push Piers:**
- Steel piers driven to bedrock
- Hydraulically pushed in place
- Lifts and stabilizes foundation
- Minimal excavation required
- Permanent load transfer

**Helical Piers:**
- Screw-type piers
- Rotated into ground
- Immediate load capacity
- Good for lighter structures
- Versatile applications

### Carbon Fiber Reinforcement

Strengthening cracked foundations:

**Applications:**
- Horizontal wall cracks
- Bowing basement walls
- Crack stabilization
- Wall strengthening
- Minimal intrusion

**Benefits:**
- No excavation required
- Quick installation
- Stronger than steel
- Thin profile
- Cost-effective

### Drainage Improvements

Addressing water-related problems:

**Drainage Solutions:**
- French drain installation
- Surface drainage correction
- Sump pump systems
- Downspout extensions
- Grading improvements

**Why Drainage Matters:**
- Water is #1 foundation enemy
- Expansive soils need stable moisture
- Drainage prevents erosion
- Reduces hydrostatic pressure
- Long-term foundation protection
