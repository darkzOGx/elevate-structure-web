Looking for a load bearing wall engineer near Downey? Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of combined experience specialize in wall removal analysis, beam sizing, and open floor plan conversions for homeowners throughout Downey, Norwalk, Whittier, and the Gateway Cities region of Los Angeles County.

Whether you're opening your kitchen to the living room, creating a great room, or removing walls for renovation, professional structural engineering is essential for safe wall removal and permit approval in Downey.

## Why Do Downey Homeowners Need Load Bearing Wall Engineers?

Creating open floor plans in Downey homes requires professional engineering to:

- **Identify which walls carry structural loads**—not all walls are load-bearing
- **Design replacement beams and posts** that safely carry transferred loads
- **Ensure foundation adequacy** for concentrated post loads
- **Provide PE-stamped plans** required for Downey building permits
- **Specify proper construction methods** for safe removal

Attempting wall removal without professional engineering risks structural failure, permit issues, and safety hazards.
