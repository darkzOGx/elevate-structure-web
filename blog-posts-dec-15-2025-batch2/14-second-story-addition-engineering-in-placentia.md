Second story addition engineering enables homeowners to expand upward when lot constraints limit horizontal growth throughout Placentia, Yorba Linda, Fullerton, and North Orange County. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of combined experience specialize in analyzing existing structures for upper level additions, designing foundation reinforcement, and creating safe, code-compliant vertical expansions.

Whether you're adding a complete second floor, master suite, or bonus room above your garage, professional structural engineering is essential for successful second story construction in Placentia.

## What Is Second Story Addition Engineering?

Second story addition engineering involves evaluating the existing home's structural capacity and designing necessary modifications to support a new upper level. Licensed Professional Engineers assess foundation adequacy, existing wall framing, and load paths to ensure the complete structure—existing plus new—meets California Building Code requirements.

This comprehensive engineering addresses both the new construction and required upgrades to the existing structure below the addition.

## What Structural Systems Require Evaluation for Second Story Additions?

**Foundation Assessment**
Existing foundations must be evaluated for:
- Adequate size for increased loads
- Reinforcement adequacy
- Connection to new load path elements
- Potential underpinning or supplemental footings

**Existing Wall Framing**
First floor walls must support upper level loads:
- Load-bearing wall identification
- Stud sizing and spacing
- Header adequacy at openings
- Addition of posts and beams

**Lateral Force-Resisting System**
Complete lateral system design including:
- Shear wall layout
- Hold-down connections
- Drag struts and collectors
- Foundation anchorage

**Floor Diaphragm**
The new second floor must transfer lateral forces to shear walls through proper diaphragm design.
