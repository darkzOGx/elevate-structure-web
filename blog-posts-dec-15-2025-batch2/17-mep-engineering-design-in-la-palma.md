MEP engineering design integrates mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems into cohesive building designs throughout La Palma, Cerritos, Buena Park, and Central Orange County. Our California-licensed Professional Engineers with over 20 years of combined experience specialize in HVAC system design, electrical power and lighting, plumbing systems, and Title 24 energy compliance for commercial and residential projects.

Whether you're building new construction, renovating existing spaces, or upgrading building systems, professional MEP engineering is essential for efficient, code-compliant buildings in La Palma.

## What Is MEP Engineering Design?

MEP engineering design encompasses the design of building systems that make spaces functional, comfortable, and safe. Licensed Professional Engineers design:

**Mechanical (M)**
- Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
- Temperature control systems
- Ventilation and air quality
- Exhaust systems

**Electrical (E)**
- Power distribution systems
- Lighting design
- Emergency and standby power
- Low voltage systems

**Plumbing (P)**
- Domestic water systems
- Waste and vent systems
- Natural gas systems
- Storm drainage

## When Is MEP Engineering Required in La Palma?

**New Commercial Construction**
All commercial buildings require complete MEP engineering for permit approval and functional building systems.

**Commercial Tenant Improvements**
Renovations affecting HVAC, electrical, or plumbing systems require engineering for modified or new systems.

**Residential Custom Homes**
Complex custom homes benefit from MEP coordination to ensure optimal system performance.

**System Upgrades**
Replacing HVAC systems, upgrading electrical services, or modifying plumbing may require engineering.

**Title 24 Energy Compliance**
All new construction and significant alterations require Title 24 energy calculations and documentation.

## How Does MEP Engineering Work in Orange County?
